<body><span class="solution"><p>Think of selecting one edge of the tree at a time. But now do it in such a way that one connected component is a tree and the other connected components have just one vertex. What is a good way to make the component that is a tree into a tree with one more vertex? To prove your method works, use contradiction by assuming there is a spanning tree with lower total cost.</p></span></body>
