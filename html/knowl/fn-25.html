</h5>In a curious twist of language, mathematicians have long called The Division Algorithm or Euclid's Division Algorithm. However as computer science has grown in importance, the word algorithm has gotten a more precise definition: an algorithm is now a method to do something. There is a method (in fact there are more than one) to get the \(q\) and \(r\) that Euclid's Division Theorem gives us, and computer scientists would call these methods algorithms. Your author has chosen to break with mathematical tradition and restrict his use of the word algorithm to the more precise interpretation as a computer scientist probably would. We aren't giving a method here, so this is why the name used here is “Euclid's Division Theorem.”</span><span class="incontext"><a href="Induction.html#fn-25">in-context</a></span>
