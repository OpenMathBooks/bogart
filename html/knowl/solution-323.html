<p>Based on our examples, the enumerator for trees on \([n]\) must be \(x_1x_2 \cdots x_n(x_1 + x_2 + ··· + x_n)^{n-2}\text{.}\) When we factor out \(x_1x_2 \cdots x_n\) from the enumerator of trees, the result is a sum of terms of degree \(n - 2\text{.}\) (The degree of \(x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}\) is \(i_1 +i_2 +\cdots+i)n\text{.}\)) We want to show this sum of terms of degree \(n-2\) is \((x_1 +x_2 +\cdots+x_n)^{n-2}\text{.}\) So let us analyze this power of a multinomial. It is a sum of terms of the form \(x_{i_1}x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_{n-2}}\) (where \(x_{i_j}\) may equal \(x_{i_k}\) ). The factor \(x_{i_1}\) is chosen from the first \((x_1 +x_2 +\cdots +x_n)\) in the product. The factor \(x_{i_2}\) is chosen from the second \((x_1 + x_2 + \cdots+ x_n)\) in the product. The factor \(x_{i_{n-2}}\) is chosen from the last \((x_1 +x_2 +\cdots +x_n)\) in the product. Thus the product is the sum, over all ordered lists \(i_1,i_2,\dots ,i_{n-2}\) of \(x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_{n-2}}\text{.}\) Thus we want to show that each list determines exactly one tree, and each tree determines exactly one list. But we did exactly this in <a knowl="./knowl/prufer-props.html" knowl-id="xref-prufer-props" alt="Problem 112 " title="Problem 112 ">Problem 112</a>. We do need just a bit more than the bijection of <a knowl="./knowl/prufer-props.html" knowl-id="xref-prufer-props" alt="Problem 112 " title="Problem 112 ">Problem 112</a>, though. The list of numbers we get from a tree determines a monomial in the \(x\)s. We need to know that when we multiply this monomial by \(x_1x_2 \cdots x_n\text{,}\) we get the picture of the tree we started with. If the tree is a two vertex tree this statement is trivial, and if the tree has three vertices, this is straightforward to prove. Thus we proceed by induction. We assume that \(n &gt; 3\) and when applied to a tree with the \((n-1)\)-element vertex set \(i_1, i_2, \dots, i_{n-1}\text{,}\) the bijection of <a knowl="./knowl/prufer-props.html" knowl-id="xref-prufer-props" alt="Problem 112 " title="Problem 112 ">Problem 112</a> carries the tree to a sequence whose monomial multiplied by \(x_{i_1} x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_{n-1}}\) is the picture of the tree. Then, given a tree on \(n\) vertices, our bijection has us remove the lowest numbered vertex of degree one to give a tree on \(n\) vertices. Assuming that the edge removed is \(x_ix_j\text{,}\) the picture of the tree on \(n\) vertices is \(x_ix_j\) times the picture of the resulting tree. But by our inductive hypothesis, the picture of the \((n - 1)\)-vertex tree is the picture provided by the monomial of the list which the bijection gives us and therefore the monomial that the list gives us for the \(n\)-vertex tree is also the picture of that tree. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the monomial given by the Prüfer bijection is the picture of the tree. Therefore, the picture enumerator for trees on \(n\) vertices is \(x_1x_2 \cdots x_n(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n )^{n-2}\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_genfns-idea.html#solution-323">in-context</a></span>
