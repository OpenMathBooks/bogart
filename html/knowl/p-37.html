<p>The idea of a function is ubiquitous in mathematics. A function \(f\) from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a relationship between the two sets that associates exactly one member \(f(x)\) of \(T\) with each element \(x\) in \(S\text{.}\) We will come back to the ideas of functions and relationships in more detail and from different points of view from time to time. However, the quick review above should probably let you answer these questions. If you have difficulty with them, it would be a good idea to go now to <a href="Relations.html" alt="Appendix A Relations" title="Appendix A Relations">Appendix A</a> and work through <a href="Relations.html#relationsandfunctions" alt="Section A.1 Relations as sets of Ordered Pairs" title="Section A.1 Relations as sets of Ordered Pairs">Section A.1</a> which covers this definition in more detail. You might also want to study <a href="Relations.html#digraphsoffunctions" alt="Subsection A.1.3 Digraphs of Functions" title="Subsection A.1.3 Digraphs of Functions">Section A.1.3</a> to learn to visualize the properties of functions. We will take up the topic of this section later in this chapter as well, but in less detail than is in the appendix.</p>
