<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/RotationsOfSquare.html" knowl-id="xref-RotationsOfSquare" alt="Figure 6.1.1 " title="Figure 6.1.1 ">Figure 6.1.1</a> we show a square with its four vertices labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4. We have also labeled the spot in the plane where each of these vertices falls with the same label. Then we have shown the effect of rotating the square clockwise through 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees (which is the same as rotating through 0 degrees). Underneath each of the rotated squares we have named the function that carries out the rotation. We use \(\rho\text{,}\) the Greek letter pronounced “row,” to stand for a 90 degree clockwise rotation. We use \(\rho^2\) to stand for two 90 degree rotations, and so on. We can think of the function \(\rho\) as a function on the four element set<span><a knowl="./knowl/fn-19-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-19" alt="Footnote 6.1 " title="Footnote 6.1 "><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span> \(\{1,2,3,4\}\text{.}\) In particular, for any function \(\varphi\) (the Greek letter phi, usually pronounced “fee,” but sometimes “fie”) from the plane back to itself that may move the square around but otherwise leaves it in the same place, we let \(\varphi(i)\) be the label of the place where vertex previously in position \(i\) is now. Thus \(\rho(1) =2\text{,}\) \(\rho(2)=3\text{,}\) \(\rho(3)=4\) and \(\rho(4) =1\text{.}\) Notice that \(\rho\) is a permutation on the set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\text{.}\)</p>
