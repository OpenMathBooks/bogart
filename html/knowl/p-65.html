<p>You may have noticed some standard mathematical words and phrases such as <em class="terminology">set</em>, <em class="terminology">ordered pair</em>, <em class="terminology">function</em> and so on creeping into the problems. One of our goals in these notes is to show how most counting problems can be recognized as counting all or some of the elements of a set of standard mathematical objects. For example <a knowl="./knowl/orderedpair.html" knowl-id="xref-orderedpair" alt="Problem 4 " title="Problem 4 ">Problem 4</a> is meant to suggest that the question we asked in <a knowl="./knowl/basicsandwiches.html" knowl-id="xref-basicsandwiches" alt="Problem 3 " title="Problem 3 ">Problem 3</a> was really a problem of counting all the ordered pairs consisting of a bread choice and a filling choice. We use \(A\times B\) to stand for the set of all ordered pairs whose first element is in \(A\) and whose second element is in \(B\) and we call \(A\times B\) the <em class="terminology">Cartesian product</em> of \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) so you can think of <a knowl="./knowl/orderedpair.html" knowl-id="xref-orderedpair" alt="Problem 4 " title="Problem 4 ">Problem 4</a> as asking you for the size of the Cartesian product of \(M\) and \(N\text{,}\) that is, asking you to count the number of elements of this Cartesian product.</p>
