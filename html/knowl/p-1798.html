<p>A permutation with cycle structure \(3^1 2^1\) will have one one-cycle on two-sets from the two-cycle of the original action, it will have \(\binom{3}{2}\)  two-sets in three cycles,  and will have six two-sets in six-cycles, and so will have just one six-cycle of two-sets.  Thus such a permutation has one one-cycle, one three-cycle and one six-cycle when it acts on two-sets.  There are \(2\binom{5}{3}=20\) such permutations.</p>
