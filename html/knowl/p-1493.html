<p>The four rotations and four flips of the square described before <a knowl="./knowl/dihedral2.html" knowl-id="xref-dihedral2" alt="Problem 259 " title="Problem 259 ">ProblemÂ 259</a> form a group called the dihedral group of the square. Sometimes the group is denoted \(D_8\) because it has eight elements, and sometimes the group is denoted by \(D_4\) because it deals with four vertices! Let us agree to use the notation \(D_4\) for the dihedral group of the square. There is a similar dihedral group, denoted by \(D_{n}\text{,}\) of all the rigid motions of three-dimensional space that return a regular \(n\)-gon to its original position (but might put the vertices in different places.)</p>
