<p>Suppose we deposit $5000 in a savings certificate that pays ten percent interest and also participate in a program to add $1000 to the certificate at the end of each year (from the end of the first year on) that follows (also subject to interest.) Assuming we make the $5000 deposit at the end of year 0, and letting \(a_i\) be the amount of money in the account at the end of year \(i\text{,}\) write a recurrence for the amount of money the certificate is worth at the end of year \(n\text{.}\) Solve this recurrence. How much money do we have in the account (after our year-end deposit) at the end of ten years?  At the end of 20 years?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_genfns-recurrence.html#activity-212">in-context</a></span>
