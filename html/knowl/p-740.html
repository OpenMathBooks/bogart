<p>The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function doesn't determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an <em class="terminology">ordered function</em> from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.<span><a knowl="./knowl/fn-6-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-6" alt="Footnote 3.1 " title="Footnote 3.1 "><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span> (Notice that although it is not the usual definition of a function from \(S\) to \(T\text{,}\) a function can be described as an assignment of subsets of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) so that each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these subsets.) Thus the number of ways to place the books into the bookcase is the entry in the middle column of row 5 of our table. If in addition we require each shelf to get at least one book, we are discussing the entry in the middle column of row 6 of our table. An <em class="terminology">ordered onto function</em> is one which assigns a list to each element of \(T\text{.}\) In <a knowl="./knowl/bookcase.html" knowl-id="xref-bookcase" alt="Problem 122 " title="Problem 122 ">Problem 122</a> you showed that the number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is \(\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^n (n+i-1)\text{.}\) This product occurs frequently enough that it has a name; it is called the \(k\)\/th <em class="terminology">rising factorial power</em> of \(n\) and is denoted by \(n^{\overline{k}}\text{.}\)  It is read as ``\(n\) to the \(k\) rising.'' (This notation is due to Don Knuth, who also suggested the notation for falling factorial powers.) We can summarize with a theorem that adds two more formulas for the number of ordered functions.</p>
