<p>We are asking for the number of orbits of \(D_5\) on lists of five colors chosen from the given four with no two adjacent colors equal; we consider the first and last position adjacent as well. The identity fixes all such colorings. For those who are familiar with the chromatic polynomial, as in <a knowl="./knowl/chrompolydel_cont.html" knowl-id="xref-chrompolydel_cont" alt="Problem 243 " title="Problem 243 ">ProblemÂ 243</a>, the number of such colorings is the chromatic polynomial of the cycle on five vertices evaluated at 4. The number of ways to properly color a cycle on five vertices is the number of ways to color a path on five vertices minus the number of ways to color a path on five vertices so that its first and last vertices are identical, which is the number of ways to color a cycle on four vertices. The number of ways to color a cycle on four vertices is the number of ways to color a path on four vertices minus the number of ways to color a path on four vertices so that the first and last vertices are the same color, which is the same as the number of ways to color a cycle on three vertices. The number of ways to properly color a path on five vertices with four colors is \(4\cdot3^4\text{.}\) The number of ways to properly color a path on four vertices with four colors is \(4\cdot3^3\text{.}\) The number ways to properly color a cycle on three vertices with four colors is \(4\cdot3\cdot2\text{.}\) Thus the number of proper colorings of a five vertex cycle with four colors is \(4\cdot3^4-4\cdot3^3
+4\cdot3\cdot2=240\text{.}\) This is the number of colorings fixed by the identity. No proper coloring is fixed by a nontrivial rotation, because if a rotation of the five cycle fixes a coloring, all the vertices must have the same color. No proper coloring is fixed by a flip, because for a flip to fix a coloring, the coloring must give the same color to two adjacent vertices. Thus the number of really different proper four-colorings of a cycle on 5 vertices is \(\frac{240}{10}=24\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_groups-groupsact.html#solution-514">in-context</a></span>
