<p>We have now completed all our distribution problems except for those in which both the objects and the recipients are identical. For example, we might be putting identical apples into identical paper bags. In this case all that matters is how many bags get one apple (how many recipients get one object), how many get two, how many get three, and so on. Thus for each bag we have a number, and the multiset of numbers of apples in the various bags is what determines our distribution of apples into identical bags. A multiset of positive integers that add to \(n\) is called a <em class="terminology">partition</em> of \(n\text{.}\) Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of \(k\) is denoted by \(P(k)\text{;}\) in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that \(P(3) = 3\text{.}\) It is traditional to use Greek letters like \(\lambda\) (the Greek letter \(\lambda\) is pronounced LAMB duh) to stand for partitons; we might write \(\lambda= 1,1,1\text{,}\) \(\gamma= 2,1\) and \(\tau = 3\) to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write \(\lambda = 1^3\) as a shorthand for \(\lambda = 1,1,1\text{,}\) and we write \(\lambda \dashv 3\) as a shorthand for ``\(\lambda\) is a partition of three."</p>
