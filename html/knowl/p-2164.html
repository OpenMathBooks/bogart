<p>Let us see how the exponential formula applies to the examples in <a knowl="./knowl/exp_oneblock_.html" knowl-id="xref-exp_oneblock_" alt="Problem 409 " title="Problem 409 ">Problems 409</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/exp_oneortwo-cycle_.html" knowl-id="xref-exp_oneortwo-cycle_" alt="Problem 410 " title="Problem 410 ">410</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/exp_two-cycle_.html" knowl-id="xref-exp_two-cycle_" alt="Problem 411 " title="Problem 411 ">411</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/exp_onecycle_.html" knowl-id="xref-exp_onecycle_" alt="Problem 412 " title="Problem 412 ">412</a>. In <a knowl="./knowl/oneblockpartitions.html" knowl-id="xref-oneblockpartitions" alt="Problem 382 " title="Problem 382 ">Problem 382</a> our family \(\F\) should consist of one-block partitions of finite subsets of a set, say the set of natural numbers.  Since a partition of a set is a set of blocks whose union is \(S\text{,}\) a one-block partition whose block is \(B\) is the set \(\{B\}\text{.}\) Then any nonempty finite subset of of the positive integers is the value of exactly one structure in \(\F\text{.}\)  (There is no one-block partition of the empty set, so we have no structures using the empty set.) As you showed in <a knowl="./knowl/oneblockpartitions.html" knowl-id="xref-oneblockpartitions" alt="Problem 382 " title="Problem 382 ">Problem 382</a> the generating function for partitions with just one block is \(e^x-1\text{.}\) Thus by the exponential formula, \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the EGF for sets of subsets of the positive integers whose values are disjoint sets whose union is any particular set \(N\) of size \(n\text{.}\) This set of disjoint sets partitions the set \(N\text{.}\) Thus \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the EGF for partitions of sets of size \(n\text{.}\) (As we wrote our description, it is the EGF for partitions of \(n\)-element subsets of the positive integers, but any two \(n\)-element sets have the same number of partitions.) In other words, \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the exponential generating function for the Bell numbers \(B_n\text{.}\)</p>
