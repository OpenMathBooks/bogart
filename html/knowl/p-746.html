<p>A <em class="terminology">multiset</em> chosen from a set \(S\) may be thought of as a subset with repeated elements allowed. For example the multiset of letters of the word Mississippi is \(\{i,i,i,i,m,p,p,s,s,s,s\}\text{.}\) To determine a multiset we must say how many times (including, perhaps, zero) each member of \(S\) appears in the multiset. The number of times an element appears is called its <em class="terminology">multiplicity</em>. The size of a multiset chosen from \(S\) is the total number of times any member of \(S\) appears. For example, the size of the multiset of letters of Mississippi is 11. What is the number of multisets of size \(k\) that can be chosen from an \(n\)-element set?</p>
