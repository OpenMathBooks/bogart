<p>In <a href="s1-3-apps.html#Ramseysection" alt="Subsection 1.3.4 Ramsey Numbers" title="Subsection 1.3.4 Ramsey Numbers">Section 1.3.4</a> we introduced the idea of a directed graph. Graphs consist of vertices and edges. We describe vertices and edges in much the same way as we describe points and lines in geometry: we don't really say what vertices and edges are, but we say what they do. We just don't have a complicated axiom system the way we do in geometry. A <em class="terminology">graph</em> consists of a set \(V\) called a vertex set and a set \(E\) called an edge set. Each member of \(V\) is called a <em class="terminology">vertex</em> and each member of \(E\) is called an <em class="terminology">edge</em>. Associated with each edge are two (not necessarily different) vertices called its endpoints. We draw pictures of graphs by drawing points to represent the vertices and line segments (curved if we choose) whose endpoints are at vertices to represent the edges. In <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-Threegraphs" alt="Figure 2.3.1 " title="Figure 2.3.1 ">Figure 2.3.1</a> we show three pictures of graphs.</p>
