<article class="introduction" id="introduction-21"><p id="p-294">Your formula for the Catalan Number can be expressed as a binomial coefficient divided by an integer. Whenever we have a formula that calls for division by an integer, an ideal combinatorial explanation of the formula is one that uses the quotient principle. The purpose of this problem is to find such an explanation using diagonal lattice paths.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-3" id="fn-3"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-3" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The result we will derive is called the Chung-Feller Theorem; this approach is based of a paper of Wen-jin Woan “Uniform Partitions of Lattice Paths and Chung-Feller Generalizations,” <span class="booktitle">American Mathematics Monthly</span> 58 June/July 2001, p556.</span></span> A diagonal lattice path that never goes below the \(y\)-coordinate of its first point is called a <em class="terminology">Dyck Path</em>. We will call a Dyck Path from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\) a <em class="terminology">Catalan Path</em> of length \(2n\text{.}\) Thus the number of Catalan Paths of length \(2n\) is the Catalan Number \(C_n\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-59"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>

<p id="p-297">Thought of as a curve in the plane, a diagonal lattice path can have many local maxima and minima, and can have several absolute maxima and minima, that is, several highest points and several lowest points. What is the \(y\)-coordinate of an absolute minimum point of a Dyck Path starting at \((0,0)\text{?}\)  Explain why a Dyck Path whose rightmost absolute minimum point is its last point is a Catalan Path.</p>

<p id="p-300">Let \(D\) be the set of all diagonal lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\text{.}\)  (Thus these paths can go below the \(x\)-axis.) Suppose we partition \(D\) by letting \(B_i\) be the set of lattice paths in \(D\) that have \(i\) upsteps (perhaps mixed with some downsteps) following the last absolute minimum.  How many blocks does this partition have?  Give a succinct description of the block \(B_0\text{.}\)</p>
<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-hint-44" id="hint-44"><span class="solution"><span class="type">Hint</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-hint-44" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><p id="p-301">What makes this part difficult is understanding how we are partitioning the paths. As an example, \(B_0\) is the set of all paths that have no upsteps following the last absolute minimum. Can such a path have downsteps after the last absolute minimum? (The description we gave of \(B_0\) is not succinct enough to be the answer to the second question of this part.) As another example \(B_1\) is the set of all paths that have exactly one upstep and perhaps some downsteps after the last absolute minimum. Is it possible, though, for a path in \(B_1\) to have any downsteps after the last absolute minimum? A path in \(B_2\) has exactly two upsteps after its last absolute minimum. If is possible to have one downstep after the last absolute minimum, but it has to be in a special place. What place is that? Now to figure out how many parts our partition has, we need to know the maximum number of upsteps a path can have following its last absolute minimum. What is this maximum? It might help to draw some pictures with \(n = 5\) or \(6\text{.}\) In particular, is it possible that all upsteps occur after the last absolute minimum?</p></span></span></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-62"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>

<p id="p-305">We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block \(B_i\) for each \(i\) between \(1\) and \(n\text{.}\)  For now, suppose the value of \(i\text{,}\) while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece \(F\) (for “front”) consists of all steps before the \(i\)th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece \(U\) (for “up”) consists of the \(i\)th upstep.  The piece \(B\) (for “back”) is the portion of the path that follows the \(i\)th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as \(FUB\text{.}\)  Show that the function that takes \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block \(B_i\) of the partition.  (Notice that \(BUF\) can go below the \(x\) axis.)</p>
<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-hint-45" id="hint-45"><span class="solution"><span class="type">Hint</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-hint-45" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><p id="p-306">Using \(d\) for down and \(u\) for up, we could have \(uudduuddudud\) as our Catalan path. Suppose that \(i = 5\text{.}\) The fifth upstep is the \(u\) in position 9. Thus \(F = uudduudd\text{,}\) \(U = u\text{,}\) and \(B = dud\text{.}\) Now \(BU F\) is \(duduuudduudd\text{.}\) This is a Dyck path that begins by going below the \(x\)-axis. The \(d\)'s in positions 1 and 3 take the path to the \(y\)-coordinate \(-1\text{.}\) Then the \(y\) coordinate climbs to 2, goes back to 0, up to 2 again, and finally down to 0. So the absolute minimum is \(-1\text{,}\) and it occurs in the first and third position. There are five \(u\)'s after the third positon. So this Dyck path is in the block \(B_5\) of our partition. Now comes the crucial question. Why were there five u's after that last absolute minimum in position 3? Try with the same path and \(i = 3\text{.}\) Figure out why there are three u's after the last absolute minimum in the resulting path. All this discussion should explain why when \(i = 5\text{,}\) the set of all Catalan paths is mapped into the set \(B_5\text{.}\) Keeping \(i = 5\) for a while, try to see why this correspondence between Catalan paths and \(B_5\) is a bijection. Then, if you need to, do the same thing with \(i = 3\text{.}\) This should give you enough insight to do the general case.</p></span></span></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-64"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>
