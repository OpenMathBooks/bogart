<p>The last sequence of problems shows that we may think of any graph as the set of its connected component graphs. (Once we know them, we know all the vertices and all the edges of the graph). Notice that a graph is connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component. Since the connected components form a partition of the vertex set of a graph, the exponential formula will relate the EGF for the number of connected graphs on \(n\) vertices with the EGF for the number of graphs (connected or not) on \(n\) vertices. However because we can draw as many edges as we want between two vertices of a graph, there are infinitely many graphs on \(n\) vertices, and so the problem of counting them is uninteresting. We can make it interesting by considering <em class="terminology">simple graphs</em>, namely graphs in which each edge has two distinct endpoints and no two edges connect the same two vertices. It is because connected graphs form the building blocks for viewing all graphs as sets of connected components that we refer to the building blocks for structures counted by the EGF in the exponential formula as connected structures.</p>
