<body><span class="solution"><p>In <a knowl="./knowl/initialdigraph2.html" knowl-id="xref-initialdigraph2" alt="Problem 334 " title="Problem 334 ">Problem 334</a>, each vertex representing a name has just one arrow leaving it. This means exactly one letter is related to each name, so this relation is the relation of a function from the set of names to the set of letters. In <a knowl="./knowl/initialdigraph.html" knowl-id="xref-initialdigraph" alt="Problem 333 " title="Problem 333 ">Problem 333</a>, the vertex \(P\) has two arrows leaving it. Therefore two elements are associated with the letter \(P\text{,}\) so this relation is not the relation of a function from the set of letters to the set of names.</p></span></body>
