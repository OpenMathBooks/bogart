<p>\(m\cdot n\text{.}\) This is because if \(M = \{x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_m\}\text{,}\) then we have \(n\) ordered pairs starting with \(x_1\text{,}\) \(n\) ordered pairs starting with \(x_2\text{,}\) and so on, so the total number of ordered pairs is a sum of \(m\) terms, all equal to \(n\text{.}\) In <a knowl="./knowl/basicsandwiches.html" knowl-id="xref-basicsandwiches" alt="Problem 3 " title="Problem 3 ">problem 3</a> we were looking at ordered pairs of bread and filling. Less directly, and so not required for the answer, In <a knowl="./knowl/fiveteamtournament.html" knowl-id="xref-fiveteamtournament" alt="Problem 1 " title="Problem 1 ">Problem 1</a> we have 20 ordered pairs, and each baseball game involved two of the ordered pairs so we had 10 baseball games. The same argument applies to <a knowl="./knowl/baseball2.html" knowl-id="xref-baseball2" alt="Problem 2 " title="Problem 2 ">Problem 2</a>; namely we have \(n\) teams each of which is in an ordered pair with \(n-1\) other teams, so we have \(n(n-1)\) ordered pairs, and each game corresponds to two ordered pairs so we have \(n(n-1)/2\) games. This gives us one proof of the formula we mentioned in the solution to that problem.</p>
