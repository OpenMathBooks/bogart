<p>Some people might say that we really had five base cases, \(n=20\text{,}\) 21, 22, 23, and 24, in the proof above and once we had proved those five consecutive base cases, then we could reduce any other case to one of these base cases by successively subtracting 5. That is an appropriate way to look at the proof. A logician would say that it is also the case that, for example, by proving we could make 22 cents, we also proved that if we can make 20 cents and 21 cents in stamps, then we could also make 22 cents. We just didn't bother to use the assumption that we could make 20 cents and 21 cents! So long as one point of view or the other satisfies you, you are ready to use this kind of argument in proofs.</p>
