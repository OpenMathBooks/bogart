<article class="introduction" id="introduction-19"><p id="p-277">A school play requires a ten dollar donation per person; the donation goes into the student activity fund. Assume that each person who comes to the play pays with a ten dollar bill or a twenty dollar bill. The teacher who is collecting the money forgot to get change before the event. If there are always at least as many people who have paid with a ten as a twenty as they arrive the teacher won't have to give anyone an IOU for change. Suppose \(2n\) people come to the play, and exactly half of them pay with ten dollar bills.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-53"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
