<p>This example suggests that we could say that \((1+x)^n\) is the generating function for the falling factorial powers \(n^{\underline{i}}\) relative to the indicator polynomials \(\frac{x^i}{i!}\text{.}\) In general, a sequence of polynomials is called a family of <em class="terminology">indicator polynomials</em> if there is one polynomial of each nonnegative integer degree in the sequence. Those familiar with linear algebra will recognize that this says that a family of indicator polynomials form a basis for the vector space of polynomials. This means that each polynomial way can be expressed as a sum of numerical multiples of indicator polynomials in one and only one way. One could use the language of linear algebra to define indicator polynomials in an even more general way, but a definition in such generality would not be useful to us at this point.</p>
