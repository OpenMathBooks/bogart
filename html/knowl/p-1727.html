<p>Suppose now we have a group \(G\) acting on a set and we have a picture function on that set with the additional feature that for each orbit of the group, all its elements have the same picture. In this circumstance we define the picture of an orbit or multiorbit to be the picture of any one of its members. The <em class="terminology">orbit enumerator</em> \(\Orb(G,S)\) is the sum of the pictures of the orbits. (Note that this is the same as the sum of the pictures of the <em class="terminology">multiorbits</em>.) The <em class="terminology">fixed point enumerator</em> \(\Fix(G, S)\) is the sum of the pictures of each of the fixed points of each of the elements of \(G\text{.}\) We are going to construct a generating function analog of the CFB theorem. The main idea of the proof of the CFB theorem was to try to compute in two different ways the number of elements (i.e. the sum of all the multiplicities of the elements) in the union of all the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. Suppose instead we try to compute the sum of all the pictures of all the elements in the union of the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. By thinking about how this sum relates to \(\Orb(G,S)\) and \(\Fix(G,S)\text{,}\) find an analog of the CFB theorem that relates these two enumerators. State and prove this theorem. </p>
