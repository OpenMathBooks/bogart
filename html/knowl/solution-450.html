<p>It suffices by symmetry to show that half the permutations that take vertex 1 to itself are rotations and half are reflections. There are six permutations corresponding to isometries that take vertex 1 to vertex 1. We already know that three of them are rotations of the cube around an axis through vertex 1 and vertex 7. One of them reflects through the plane bisecting and perpendicular to the edges 1, 5 and 3, 7. One of them reflects through the plane bisecting and perpendicular to the edges 1, 4 and 6, 7. One of them reflects through the plane bisecting and perpendicular to the edges 1, 2 and 7, 8. Thus half of the isometries that take vertex 1 to vertex 1 are reflections, and by symmetry, half of the isometries (or in other words, 24 of them) are reflections. The other half (again, 24 isometries) are rotations. Thus every isometry is either a rotation or a reflection.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_groups-permgroups.html#solution-450">in-context</a></span>
