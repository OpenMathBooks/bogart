<p>Suppose we add, for each person, the number of people with whom he or she is acquainted. Then we get twice the number of acquaintance edges in the graph of acquaintance and non-acquaintance relationships. Thus the sum must be even. But if each person among an odd number of people were acquainted with an odd number of people, then the sum would be odd. Since this is a contradiction, among an odd number of people, there must be at least one who is acquainted with an even number of people. Since the number of people different from this person is even, the number of people with whom this person is not acquainted is also even.</p>
