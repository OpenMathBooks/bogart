<p>The idea of coloring a set \(S\) has many applications. For example, the set \(S\) might be the positions in a hydrocarbon molecule which are occupied by hydrogen, and the group could be the group of spatial symmetries of the molecule (that is, the group of permutations of the atoms of the molecule that move the molecule around so that in its final position the molecule cannot be distinguished from the original molecule). The colors could then be radicals (including hydrogen itself) that we could substitute for each hydrogen position in the molecule. Then the number of orbits of colorings is the number of chemically different compounds we could create by using these substitutions.<span><a knowl="./knowl/fn-24-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-24" alt="Footnote 6.6 " title="Footnote 6.6 "><span class="footnote"><sup> 6 </sup></span></a></span></p>
