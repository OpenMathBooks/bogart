<p>Start with the original vertex set and no edges for a graph \(H\text{.}\) Go through the edges of the original graph \(G\) one at a time, and if you can add an edge of \(G\) to the graph \(H\) without creating a cycle, do so. Otherwise discard the edge and go on to the next one. This will give you a graph \(H\) with no cycles, and if it were not connected, there would be an edge in \(G\) between two vertices not yet connected in \(H\text{.}\) (If there weren't, the graph you just constructed would be connected.) Thus you get a spanning tree.</p>
