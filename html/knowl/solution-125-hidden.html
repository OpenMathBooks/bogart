<body><span class="solution"><p>Each sequence in the Gray code is the characteristic function of a set, and the number of elements of the set is the number of ones in the sequence. Since each sequence differs in just one place from the preceding one, the sequences alternate between having an even number of ones and an odd number of ones. Since the first sequence is all zeros and there are \(2^n\) sequences, the last one has an odd number of zeros. Thus the map that takes each sequence except the last to the next one, and takes the last to the first is a bijection between the characteristic functions of sets with an even number of elements and sets with an odd number of elements.</p></span></body>
