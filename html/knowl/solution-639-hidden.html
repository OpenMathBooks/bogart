<body><span class="solution"><p>In <a href="s3-1-distrib-idea.html#orderedfunctionsection" alt="Subsection 3.1.2 Ordered functions" title="Subsection 3.1.2 Ordered functions">Section 3.1.2</a> we remarked that an alternate definition of a function from \(S\) to \(T\) is that it is an assignment of disjoint subsets of \(S\) to elements of \(T\) so that the union of the subsets is \(S\text{.}\) Thus a function from \([k]\) to \([n]\) may be thought of as an \(n\)-tuple of disjoint subsets of \(S\) whose union is \([k]\text{.}\) In particular, an injection from \([k]\) to \([n]\) (which is a \(k\)-element permutation of \([n]\)) can be thought of as a \(n\)-tuple of disjoint singleton sets and empty sets whose union is \(n\text{.}\) The number of such \(n\)-tuples is therefore the number of \(k\)-element permutations of \([n]\text{.}\) If \(n=1\text{,}\) the possible \(n\)-tuples are \((\emptyset)\) and \(\{1\}\text{,}\) and so the EGF for such \(n\)-tuples is \(1+x\text{.}\) Then by <a knowl="./knowl/fspeciescorollary1.html" knowl-id="xref-fspeciescorollary1" alt="Corollary C.4.2 " title="Corollary C.4.2 ">Corollary C.4.2</a>, if we let the value of an \(n\)-tuple of disjoint singletons and empty sets be the union of the sets in the \(n\)-tuple, the EGF for the number of \(n\)-tuples whose value is \([k]\) is \((1+x)^n\text{.}\) Thus this is the EGF for \(k\)-element permutations of \([n]\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
