<p>Recall that a <em class="terminology">derangement</em> of \([n]\) is a permutation of \([n]\) that has no fixed points, or equivalently is a way to pass out \(n\) hats to their \(n\) different owners so that nobody gets the correct hat. Use \(d_n\) to stand for the number of derangements of \([n]\text{.}\) We can think of derangement of \([n]\) as a list of \(1\) through \(n\) so that \(i\) is not in the \(i\)th place for any \(n\text{.}\) Thus in a derangement, some number \(k\) different from \(n\) is in position \(n\text{.}\) Consider two cases: either \(n\) is in position \(k\) or it is not. Notice that in the second case, if we erase position \(n\) and replace \(n\) by \(k\text{,}\) we get a derangement of \([n-1]\text{.}\) Based on these two cases, find a recurrence for \(d_n\text{.}\) What is \(d_1\text{?}\) What is \(d_2\text{?}\) What is \(d_0\text{?}\) What are \(d_3\) through \(d_6\text{?}\)</p>
