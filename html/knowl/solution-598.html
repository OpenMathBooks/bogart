<p>One possible value of \(k\) that is greater than 1 is 2. When we have a set \(S\) of two elements and we argue that the first \(k-1\) elements are equal and the last \(k-1\) elements are equal, we cannot conclude from those equalities that all elements of \(S\) are equal, because there is no overlap among the first \(k-1=1\) elements of \(S\) and the last \(k-1=1\) elements of \(S\text{.}\) Thus our inductive step does not cover the possibility that \(k=2\text{.}\) Therefore our inductive step does not show that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement for \(n=k\) for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all</em> integers \(n&gt;1\text{.}\) Therefore the principle of mathematical induction does not apply.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="Induction.html#solution-598">in-context</a></span>
