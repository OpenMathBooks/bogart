<p>Some problems are marked with open circles. This indicates that they are designed to provide motivation for, or an introduction to, the important concepts, motivation with which some students may already be familiar. You will also see that some problems are marked with arrows. These point to problems that I think are particularly interesting. Some of them are also difficult, but not all are. A few problems that summarize ideas that have come before but aren't really essential are marked with a plus, and problems that are essential if you want to cover the section they are in or, perhaps, the next section, are marked with a dot (a small bullet). If a problem is relevant to a much later section in an essential way, I've marked it with a dot and a parenthetical note that explains where it will be essential. Finally, problems that seem unusually hard to me are marked with an asterisk. Some I've marked as hard only because I think they are difficult in light of what has come before, not because they are intrinsically difficult. In particular, some of the problems marked as hard will not seem so hard if you come back to them after you have finished more of the problems.</p>
