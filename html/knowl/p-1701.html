<p>A flip, on the other hand can fix some colorings. In particular, if \(n\) is even, we color one edge blue, leaving an even number \(n\) of edges to be colored blue and an even number \(n\) of edges to be colored red. It the flip over the axis perpendicular to the side we picked fixes the coloring, the \(n\) edges to the right of the chosen edge must be colored identically with the \(n\) edges to the left of the chosen edge. There are \(\binom{n}{n/2}\) ways to color the \(n\) edges to the right of the chosen edge (choose which edges get red), and so this is the number of colorings fixed by this flip. We have \(2n+1\) flips, and since we have one flip of the type described for each edge, all flips have the form given above. Thus each flip fixes \(\binom{n}{n/2}\) colorings.</p>
