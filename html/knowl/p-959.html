<p>We have seen that the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is equal to the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients so that each receives at least one. If we relax the condition that each recipient receives at least one, then we see that the number of distributions of \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients is \(\sum_{i=1}^n P(k,i)\) because if some recipients receive nothing, it does not matter which recipients these are. This completes rows 7 and 8 of our table of distribution problems. The completed table is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/lastdistributiontable.html" knowl-id="xref-lastdistributiontable" alt="Table 3.3.5 " title="Table 3.3.5 ">Table 3.3.5</a>. There are quite a few theorems that you have proved which are summarized by <a knowl="./knowl/lastdistributiontable.html" knowl-id="xref-lastdistributiontable" alt="Table 3.3.5 " title="Table 3.3.5 ">Table 3.3.5</a>.  It would be worthwhile to try to write them all down!</p>
