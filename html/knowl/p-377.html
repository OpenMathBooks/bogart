<p><a knowl="./knowl/R_3_3_.html" knowl-id="xref-R_3_3_" alt="Problem 65 " title="Problem 65 ">Problems 65–66</a> together show that six is the smallest number \(R\) with the property that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is either a set of (at least) three mutual acquaintances or a set of (at least) three mutual strangers. Another way to say the same thing is to say that six is the smallest number so that no matter how we connect 6 points in the plane (no three on a line) with red and green lines, we can find either a red triangle or a green triangle. There is a name for this property. The <em class="terminology">Ramsey Number</em> \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is a set of at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n\) mutual strangers. There is also a geometric description of Ramsey Numbers; it uses the idea of a <em class="terminology">complete graph</em> on \(R\) vertices. A <em class="terminology">complete graph</em> on \(R\) vertices consists of \(R\) points in the plane together with line segments (or curves) connecting each two of the \(R\) vertices.<span><a knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-4" alt="Footnote 1.4 " title="Footnote 1.4 "><span class="footnote"><sup> 4 </sup></span></a></span> The points are called <em class="terminology">vertices</em> and the line segments are called <em class="terminology">edges</em>. In <a knowl="./knowl/completegraph.html" knowl-id="xref-completegraph" alt="Figure 1.3.2 " title="Figure 1.3.2 ">Figure 1.3.2</a> we show three different ways to draw a complete graph on four vertices. We use \(K_n\) to stand for a complete graph on \(n\) vertices.</p>
