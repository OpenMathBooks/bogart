<p>After some more examples, we will see how to show that equivalence relations have the kind of clumping property you saw in the directed graphs. In our first example, using the notation \((a,b) \in R\) to say that \(a\) is related to \(B\) is going to get in the way. It is really more common to write \(a
R b\) to mean that \(a\) is related to \(b\text{.}\) For example, if our relation is the less than relation on \(\{1,2,3\}\text{,}\) you are much more likely to use \(x\lt y\) than you are \((x,y)\in \ \lt\text{,}\) aren't you? The reflexive law then says \(xRx\) for every \(x\) in \(X\text{,}\) the symmetric law says that if \(xRy\text{,}\) then \(yRx\text{,}\) and the transitive law says that if \(xRy\) and \(yRz\text{,}\) then \(xRz\text{.}\)</p>
