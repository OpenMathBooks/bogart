<body><span class="solution"><p>Let us take the pictures of red and blue to be \(R\) and \(B\text{.}\) Since the hexagon is free to move in the plane, our group \(G\) is the group \(R_6\) of rotations of a regular hexagon. There are four kinds of elements of \(G\text{:}\) the identity, the rotation \(\rho\) through 60 degrees and the rotation \(\rho^5\) through 300 degrees (when written as a product of disjoint cycles, the corresponding permutations are six-cycles), the rotations \(\rho^2\) and \(\rho^4\) through 120 and 240 degrees respectively (when written as a product of disjoint cycles, the corresponding permutations are products of two three cycles), and the rotation \(\rho^3\) through 180 degrees (when written as a product of disjoint cycles this is a product of three two-cycles). All \(2^6\) functions are fixed by the identity. By <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-PictureEnumeratorforFunctions" alt="Problem 313 " title="Problem 313 ">Problem 313</a> the enumerator for these functions is \((R+B)^6\text{.}\) Only the two constant functions (that color every circle the same color) are fixed by \(\rho\) or \(\rho^5\text{.}\) The picture enumerator of the two constant functions is \(R^6+B^6\text{.}\) If the vertices are numbered one through six clockwise, then \(\rho^2\) is \((1\ 3\ 5)(2\ 4\ 6)\text{.}\) Thus for a function \(f\) to be fixed by \(\rho^2\text{,}\) \(f(1)=f(3)=f(5)\) and \(f(2)=f(4)=f(6)\text{.}\) Thus the color of vertex 1 is repeated on vertex 3 and 5, and the color of vertex 2 is repeated on vertices 4 and 6. Therefore the picture enumerator for functions fixed by \(\rho^2\) and \(\rho^4\) is \(R^3R^3 +R^3B^3+B^3R^3 +B^3B^3=(R^3+B^3)^2\text{.}\) We can also think of this as the picture enumerator for functions defined on the cycles of the permutation. There are two possible pictures of a colored cycle, \(R^3\) and \(B^3\text{,}\) so the picture enumerator for one cycle is \(R^3+B^3\text{.}\) That is, the picture of assigning red to a cycle is \(R^3\) and the picture of assigning blue to a cycle is \(B^3\text{.}\) By <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-PictureEnumeratorforFunctions" alt="Problem 313 " title="Problem 313 ">Problem 313</a>, the picture enumerator for functions defined on the two cycles is then \((R^3+B^3)^2\text{.}\) If a function \(f\) is fixed by \(\rho^3=(1\ 4)(2\ 5)(3\ 6)\text{,}\) then \(f(1)=f(4)\text{,}\) \(f(2)=f(5)\text{,}\) and \(f(3)=f(6)\text{,}\) so \(f\) is determined by the three values \(f(1)\text{,}\) \(f(2)\text{,}\) and \(f(3)\text{.}\) The picture enumerator for these functions is, by <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-PictureEnumeratorforFunctions" alt="Problem 313 " title="Problem 313 ">Problem 313</a> applied to colorings of the cycles, \((R^2+B^2)^3\text{.}\) Therefore the fixed point enumerator for the action of \(G\) on the colorings is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\Fix(G,S)= (R+B)^6 +(R^2+B^2)^3 +2(R^3+B^3) + 2(R^6+B^6).
\end{equation*}
<p>Then the orbit enumerator for the action of \(G\) on the colorings is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\Orb(G,S)=\frac{1}{6}\left((R+B)^6 +(R^2+B^2)^3 +2(R^3+B^3)^2 +
2(R^6+B^6)\right).
\end{equation*}
<p>Expanding this gives us</p>
\begin{equation*}
R^6+R^5B+3R^4B^2+4R^3B^3+3R^2B^4+RB5+B^6.
\end{equation*}
<p>Thus we have one all-red orbit, one all-blue orbit, one orbit with five reds and a blue, one with five blues and a red, three orbits with four reds and two blues as well as three with two reds and four blues, and four orbits with three reds and three blues.</p></span></body>
