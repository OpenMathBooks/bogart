<p>Seeing this right triangle leads us to ask whether there is some natural way to extend the right triangle to a rectangle. If we did have a rectangular table of binomial coefficients, counting the first row as row zero (i.e., \(n=0\)) and the first column as column zero (i.e., \(k=0\)), the entries we don't yet have are values of \(\binom{n}{k}\) for \(k&gt;n\text{.}\) But how many \(k\)-element subsets does an \(n\)-element set have if \(k&gt;n\text{?}\) The answer, of course, is zero, so all the other entries we would fill in would be zero, giving us the rectangular array in <a knowl="./knowl/Pascal_sRectangle.html" knowl-id="xref-Pascal_sRectangle" alt="Table 1.2.6 " title="Table 1.2.6 ">FigureÂ 1.2.6</a>. It is straightforward to check that Pascal's equation now works for all the entries in the rectangle that have an entry above them and an entry above and to the left.</p>
