<p>The function \(\iota\) (the Greek letter iota is pronounced eye-oh-ta) from a set \(S\) to itself, given by the rule \(\iota(x) = x\) for every \(x\) in \(S\text{,}\) is called the <em class="terminology">identity function</em> on S.  If \(f\) is a function from \(S\) to \(T\) and \(g\) is a function from \(T\) to \(S\) such that \(g(f(x)) = x\) for every \(x\) in \(S\text{,}\) we can express this by saying that \(g\circ f = \iota\text{,}\) where \(\iota\) is the identity function of \(S\text{.}\) Saying that \(f(g(x)) = x\) is the same as saying that \(f\circ g = \iota\text{,}\) where \(\iota\) stands for the identity function on \(T\text{.}\)  We use the same letter for the identity function on two different sets when we can use context to tell us on which set the identity function is being defined.</p>
