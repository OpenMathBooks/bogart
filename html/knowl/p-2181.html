<p>Therefore \(C\) is a connected component containing \(x\text{.}\) If connected component \(D\) contained \(x\text{,}\) then every vertex in \(D\) would be connected by a walk to \(x\) and then by a walk from \(x\) to \(v\) for each other vertex in \(C\text{,}\) and similarly, each vertex in \(C\) would be connected to each vertex in \(D\text{.}\) Thus by the definition of connected component, \(C\) and \(D\) would have to be the same set. Therefore each vertex lies in one and only one connected component.</p>
