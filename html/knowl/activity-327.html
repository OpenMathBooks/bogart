<p>Two simple graphs on the set \([n]= \{1,2,\ldots, n\}\) with edge sets \(E\) and \(E'\) (which we think of a sets of two-element sets for this problem) are said to be <em class="terminology">isomorphic</em> if there is a permutation \(\sigma\) of \([n]\) which, in its action of two-element sets, carries \(E\) to \(E'\text{.}\) We say two graphs are different if they are not isomorphic. Thus the number of different graphs is the number of orbits of the set of all two-element subsets of \([n]\) under the action of the group \(S_n\text{.}\) We can represent an edge set by its characteristic function (as in <a knowl="./knowl/charfunction.html" knowl-id="xref-charfunction" alt="Problem 33 " title="Problem 33 ">problemÂ 33</a>). That is we define</p>
\begin{equation*}
\chi_E(\{u,v\}) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 \amp  \mbox{if \(\{u,v\}\in E\)} \\
0 \amp  \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}
<p>Thus we can think of the set of graphs as a set of colorings with colors 0 and 1 of the set of all two-element subsets of \([n]\text{.}\) The number of different graphs with vertex set \([n]\) is thus the number of orbits of this set of colorings under the action of the symmetric group \(S_n\) on the set of two-element subsets of \([n]\text{.}\) Use this to find the number of different graphs on five vertices.</p>
