<body><span class="solution"><p>The number of spanning trees of \(G\) not containing \(e\) is the number of spanning trees of \(G-e\text{.}\) The number of spanning trees of \(G\) containing the edge \(e\) is the number of spanning trees of \(G/e\text{.}\) Therefore \(\#(G) =\#(G-e)
+\#(G/e)\text{.}\) Applying the formula twice to \(G\) gives</p>
\begin{align*}
\#(G)
= &amp;\#(G-\{1,2\}-\{2,3\}) + \#((G-\{1,2\})/\{2,3\})\\
\amp +
\#((G/\{1,2\})-\{2,3\}) +
\#(G/\{1,2\}/\{2,3\}).
\end{align*}
<p>We now show the four graphs on the right hand side of the equation.</p>

Since we can easily count spanning trees of a triangle, we can also stop here, noting that the first graph has three spanning trees, the second has six, the third has five, and the fourth has seven, so the total number of spanning trees is \(3+6+5+7=21\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
