<p>By the deletion-contraction recurrence,</p>
\begin{equation*}
\chi_{G_{12}}(x) =
\chi_{G_{12}-e}(x)-\chi_{G_{12/e}}(x).
\end{equation*}
<p>Now \(\chi_{G_{12}-e}(x)=\chi_{G_1}(x)\times \chi_{G_2}(x)\) because each ordered pair of proper colorings of \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) is a proper coloring of \(G_{12}-e\text{.}\) \(G_{12}/e\) is the graph we get by identifying the endpoint of \(e\) in \(G_1\) with the endpoint of \(e\) in \(G_2\text{.}\) Notice that if you fix one vertex of a graph \(G\text{,}\) fix one color, and ask how many proper colorings with \(x\) colors \(G\) has in which the fixed vertex is the fixed color, you get \(\chi_G(x)/x\text{.}\)  (By the quotient principle.) Thus \(\chi_{G_2}(x)/x\) is the number of ways to extend a proper coloring of \(G_1\) to a proper coloring of \(G_{12}/e\text{.}\) Then, by the product principle, the number of proper colorings of \(G_{12}/e\) with \(x\) colors is \(\chi_{G_1}(x)\chi_{G_2}(x)/x\text{.}\) Therefore by the deletion-contraction recurrence, \(\chi_{G_{12}}(x) = \chi_{G_1}(x)\chi_{G_2}(x)(1-\frac{1}{x})\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_inclexcl-suppprobs.html#solution-423">in-context</a></span>
