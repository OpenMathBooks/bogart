<p>Each time that we converted a picture function to a generating function by substituting \(x\) or some power of \(x\) for each picture, the coefficient of \(x\) had a meaning that was significant to us. For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted \(x\) for each of our pictures, the exponent \(i\) in the power \(x^i\) is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to \(x^i\text{.}\) After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of \(x\text{,}\) the coefficient of \(x^i\) is the number of fruit selections that use \(i\) pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute \(x^c\) for a picture, where \(c\) is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the \(i\) in an \(x^i\) term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to \(x^i\text{,}\) and the coefficient of \(x^i\) in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with \(i\) calories.  The product principle of picture enumerators translates directly into a product principle for generating functions.</p>
