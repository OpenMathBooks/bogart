<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetsbysmallestcounterexample" alt="Problem 360 " title="Problem 360 ">Problems 360</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/sumodd.html" knowl-id="xref-sumodd" alt="Problem 361 " title="Problem 361 ">361</a> our proofs had several distinct elements. We had a statement involving an integer \(n\text{.}\) We knew the statement was true for the first few nonnegative integers in <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetsbysmallestcounterexample" alt="Problem 360 " title="Problem 360 ">Problem 360</a> and for the first few positive integers in <a knowl="./knowl/sumodd.html" knowl-id="xref-sumodd" alt="Problem 361 " title="Problem 361 ">Problem 361</a>. We wanted to prove that the statement was true for all nonnegative integers in <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetsbysmallestcounterexample" alt="Problem 360 " title="Problem 360 ">Problem 360</a> and for all positive integers in <a knowl="./knowl/sumodd.html" knowl-id="xref-sumodd" alt="Problem 361 " title="Problem 361 ">Problem 361</a>. In both cases we used the method of proof by contradiction; for that purpose we assumed that there was a value of \(n\) for which our formula wasn't true. We then chose \(k\) to be the smallest value of \(n\) for which our formula wasn't true. This meant that when \(n\) was \(k-1\text{,}\) our formula was true, (or else that \(k-1\) wasn't a nonnegative integer in <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetsbysmallestcounterexample" alt="Problem 360 " title="Problem 360 ">Problem 360</a> or that \(k-1\) wasn't a positive integer in <a knowl="./knowl/sumodd.html" knowl-id="xref-sumodd" alt="Problem 361 " title="Problem 361 ">Problem 361</a>). What we did next was the crux of the proof. We showed that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implied the truth of our statement for \(n=k\text{.}\) This gave us a contradiction to the assumption that there was an \(n\) that made the statement false. In fact, we will see that we can bypass entirely the use of proof by contradiction. We used it to help you discover the central ideas of the technique of proof by mathematical induction.</p>
