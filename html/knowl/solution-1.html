<p>Think of numbering the five teams. The first team must play all four others, the second team will be in one of these games but must play in three more games, with the third, fourth and fifth team. The third team is in two of the games we've already mentioned, and must still play the fourth and fifth team for two more games, and the fourth team must play the fifth team in addition to playing in three of the games already mentioned. Thus there are \(4+3+2+1 = 10\) games. Alternatively, there are five teams, each of which must play in four games, giving us 20 pairings of two teams each. However each game involves two of these pairings, so there are \(20/2 =10\) games.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-2-basics.html#solution-1">in-context</a></span>
