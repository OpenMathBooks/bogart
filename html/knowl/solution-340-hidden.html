<body><span class="solution"><p>A partition with up to two parts of size up to two can have no parts, one part of size 1, which makes it a partition of 1, one part of size 2 which makes it a partition of 2, two parts of size 1, which makes it a partition of 2, a part of size 2 and a part of size 1, which makes it a partition of 3, or two parts of size 2, which makes it a partition of 4. Thus \(\qchoose{4}{2}=1+q+2q^2+q^3+q^4\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
