<p>We must show that if \(S\) and \(S'\) are finite subsets of \(X\) with the same size, then the number of pair structures on \(S\) and the number of pair structures on \(S'\) are the same. To get a pair structure on \(S\) we partition \(S\) into two parts, \(S_1\) and \(S_2\text{,}\) take an \(\F\) structure on \(S_1\) and a \(\mathcal{G}\) structure on \(S_2\) and form the ordered pair of these structures. The number of ways to partition \(S\) into sets of size \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) is the same as the number of ways to partition \(S'\) into sets \(S_1'\) and \(S_2'\) of size \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) (there are intentionally no primes on the lower case \(s_1\) and \(s_2\)) and the number of ways to choose an \(\F\)-structure on \(S_1'\) and a \(\mathcal{G}\)-structure on \(S_2'\) is the number of ways to make the same choices on \(S_1\) and \(S_2\text{.}\) Therefore the number of pairs of structures on the disjoint sets \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) whose union is \(S\) is the same as the number of pairs of structures on the disjoint sets \(S_1'\) and \(S_2'\) whose union is \(S'\text{.}\) Summing over all ways to partition \(S\) or \(S'\) into two sets, we find that the number of pair structures on \(S\) equals the number of pair structures on \(S'\text{.}\) Thus the pair structure of \(\F\cdot \mathcal{G}\) forms a species of structures.</p>
