<p>If a graph has a loop it has no proper colorings. The graph in <a knowl="./knowl/del-cont.html" knowl-id="xref-del-cont" alt="Figure 5.3.1 " title="Figure 5.3.1 ">FigureÂ 5.3.1</a> has no loops and no multiple edges between two vertices. The only way we could get a loop is by contracting one of several multiple edges between two vertices, and the resulting graph would have no contribution to the chromatic polynomial of the original graph. Thus whenever a contraction gives us a graph with multiple edges between two vertices, we can replace the multiple edges by one edge and go on with our computation from there. The graphs we get when we delete and contract the edges \(\{1,2\}\) and \(\{2,3\}\) are \((G-\{1,2\})-\{2,3\}\text{,}\) \((G-\{1,2\})/\{2,3\}\text{,}\) \((G-\{2,3\})/\{1,2\}\text{,}\) and \((G/\{2,3\})/\{1,2\}\text{.}\) These are shown in the following picture.</p>
