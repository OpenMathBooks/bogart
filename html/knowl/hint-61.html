<p>Often when there is a counter-example, there is one with a good deal of symmetry. (Caution: there is a difference between often and always!) One way to help yourself get a symmetric example, if there is one, is to put 8 vertices into a circle. Then, perhaps, you might draw green edges in some sort of regular fashion until it is impossible to draw another green edge between any two of the vertices without creating a green triangle.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-3-apps.html#hint-61">in-context</a></span>
