<body><span class="solution"><p>We must consider the action of the rotation group of the cube on functions from \([6]\) to \(\{R,B\}\) or some other two-element set of colors. There are five kinds of elements in the rotation group of the cube. There is one identity, there are six rotations by 90 degrees or 270 degrees around an axis connecting the centers of two opposite faces, there are three rotations of 180 degrees around such an axis, there are 8 rotations (of 120 degrees and 240 degrees, respectively) around an axis connecting two diagonally opposite vertices, and there are 6 rotations of 180 degrees around an axis connecting the centers of two opposite edges. The identity fixes \(2^6\) functions. There are eight functions fixed by a 90 degree or 270 degree rotation. There are 16 functions fixed by a 180 degree rotation along an axis through two faces. There are 8 functions fixed by a 180 degree rotation along an axis joining the centers of two opposite sides. There are 4 functions fixed by a 120 degree or 240 degree rotation. Thus by the CFB theorem, we have</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{24}(64+6\cdot8 + 3\cdot16+ 8\cdot 4 +6\cdot8)= 10
\end{equation*}
<p>ways to paint the faces of a cube with two colors of paint. Two of these colorings use only one color, so there are eight colorings that use both colors.</p></span></body>
