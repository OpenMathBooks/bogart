<p>Since we are starting with a Catalan path, the point on the path at the beginning of the \(i\)th upstep must have \(y\) coordinate greater or equal to than zero. Thus wherever we start the sequence \(F\) of upsteps and downsteps, a path constructed by this sequence never goes lower than its starting point. Thus in \(BUF\) the last absolute minimum is either right before the \(U\) or earlier. But \(B\) is the final segment of a Catalan Path, so its final point is at least as low as its starting point. Thus the point at the beginning of the \(U\) in \(BUF\) is an absolute minimum, and there are \(i\) upsteps after that local minimum. If we take two different sequences and rearrange them in the same way, we get two different sequences, so the function we just described is a one-to-one function. If we take an arbitrary diagonal lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\text{,}\) let \(U'\) be the first upstep after the last absolute minimum, \(F'\) be the portion of the path that follows \(U'\text{,}\) and \(B'\) be the portion that precedes \(U'\text{,}\) then \(F'U'B'\) is a Catalan Path, and \(U'\) is its \(i\)th upstep if and only if in \(B'U'F'\) there are \(i\) upsteps after the last absolute minimum. Thus the mapping from \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-3-apps.html#solution-93">in-context</a></span>
