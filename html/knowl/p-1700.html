<p>The set of all powers of a rotation is a subgroup of the dihedral group of the \((2n+1)\)-gon. If a given rotation fixes a coloring, all powers of that rotation fix the coloring. The set of edges to which a given edge is taken by that rotation is an orbit of the group of powers of the rotation. The size of this orbit is a divisor of the size of the subgroup, which is a divisor of \(2n+1\text{.}\) If the edge is colored red, the size of the orbit is also a divisor of \(n\text{,}\) and if the edge is colored blue, the size of the orbit is also a divisor of \(n+1\text{.}\) But neither \(n\) nor \(n+1\) have common divisors with \(2n+1\text{,}\) except for one. Therefore the only rotation that fixes a coloring is the identity rotation, and it fixes all \(\binom{2n+1}{n}\) colorings.</p>
