<p>When we used the quotient principle to count circular seating arrangements or necklaces, we partitioned up a set of lists of people or beads into blocks of equivalent lists. In the case of seating n people around a round table, what made two lists equivalent was, in retrospect, the action of the rotation group \(C_n\text{.}\) In the case of stringing \(n\) beads on a string to make a necklace, what made two lists equivalent was the action of the dihedral group. Thus the blocks of our partitions were orbits of the rotation group or the dihedral group, and we were counting the number of orbits of the group action. In <a knowl="./knowl/twocolorsofbeads.html" knowl-id="xref-twocolorsofbeads" alt="Problem 45 " title="Problem 45 ">ProblemÂ 45</a>, we were not able to apply the quotient principle because we had blocks of different sizes. However, these blocks were still orbits of the action of the group \(D_4\text{.}\) And, even though the orbits have different sizes, we expect that each orbit corresponds naturally to a multiorbit and that the multiorbits all have the same size. Thus if we had a version of the quotient rule for a union of multisets, we could hope to use it to count the number of multiorbits.</p>
