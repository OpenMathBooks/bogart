<p>What is wrong with the following attempt at an inductive proof that all integers in any consecutive set of \(n\) integers are equal for every positive integer \(n\text{?}\) For an arbitrary integer \(i\text{,}\) all integers from \(i\) to \(i\) are equal, so our statement is true when \(n=1\text{.}\) Now suppose \(k&gt;1\) and all integers in any consecutive set of \(k-1\) integers are equal. Let \(S\) be a set of \(k\) consecutive integers. By the inductive hypothesis, the first \(k-1\) elements of \(S\) are equal and the last \(k-1\) elements of \(S\) are equal. Therefore all the elements in the set \(S\) are equal. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, for every positive \(n\text{,}\) every \(n\) consecutive integers are equal.</p>
