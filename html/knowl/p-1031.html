<p>Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as</p>
\begin{equation*}
\ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
+\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
<p>Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus \(\ap\) stands for taking an apple, \(\ap\pe\) for taking an apple and a pear, and \(\ap\ap\) for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the “exclusive or,” that is, \(\ap+\ba\) would stand for “I take an apple or a banana but not both.” To say “I take both an apple and a banana,” we would write \(\ap\ba\text{.}\) We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to</p>
\begin{equation*}
\ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
\ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
