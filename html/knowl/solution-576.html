<p>Two lists are equivalent if I can get one from the other by some combination of cyclic permutations (putting the last thing in the list at the front and moving everything else one place right) and reversals. The combination could include no operation at all. Since it is possible to have no operation, the relation is reflexive. (Even without the opportunity to do no operation, if we do two reversals to a list we get the original list back so it is equivalent to itself.) Suppose we have \(n\) beads. Then if I can get from list \(A\) to list \(B\) with a cyclic permutations, then \(n-1\) more cyclic permutations give us the original list. Also if I get from a list \(A\) to a list \(B\) by a reversal, then another reversal takes \(B\) to \(A\text{.}\) Thus any sequence of cyclic permutations and reversals can be undone. Therefore if list \(A\) is equivalent to list \(B\text{,}\) then list \(B\) is equivalent to list \(A\text{.}\) Following one combination of operations with another one still gives a combination of operations, so our relation is transitive.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="Relations.html#solution-576">in-context</a></span>
