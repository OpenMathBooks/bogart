<p>There is a variant of one of the bijections we used to prove the Pascal Equation that comes up in counting the subsets of a set. In the next problem it will help us compute the total number of subsets of a set, regardless of their size. Our main goal in this problem, however, is to introduce some ideas that will lead us to one of the most powerful proof techniques in combinatorics (and many other branches of mathematics), the principle of mathematical induction.</p>
