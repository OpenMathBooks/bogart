<body><span class="solution"><p>Choose \(n\) books from the \(k\) books in \(\binom{k}{n}\) ways, and assign them to the \(n\) places shelves in \(n!\) ways, giving us \(k!/(k-n)!\) ways to put a book on each shelf. Now leaving these books at the far left of each shelf, place the remaining books in</p>
\begin{equation*}
\prod_{i=1}^{k-n}
(n+i-1)=\frac{(n+(k-n)-1)!}{(n-1)!}=\frac{(k-1)!}{(n-1)!}
\end{equation*}
<p>ways. Thus we have</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k!(k-1)!}{(k-n)!(n-1)!}=k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}
\end{equation*}
<p>ways to place the books. Of course the right hand side of that equation cries out for a combinatorial explanation. Here it is. Imagine lining up the \(k\) books in a row. Then there are \(k-1\) places in between them. Choose \(n-1\) of these places, and slide a piece of paper in there as a divider. Now put the books before the first divider on shelf one, and the books after divider \(i\) on shelf \(i+1\text{.}\) This gives an arrangement of the books on the shelves so that every shelf has a book!</p></span></body>
