<p>A first order recurrence will give \(a_n\) in terms of \(a_{n-1}\text{,}\) that is, there will be a function \(f\) such that \(a_n=f(a_{n-1})\) for all \(n&gt;0\text{.}\) We prove by induction that there is one and only one solution to a first order recurrence that satisfies \(a_0=a\) for some fixed constant \(a\text{.}\) First, there is one and only one value for \(a_0\text{.}\) Now suppose that when \(n=k-1\text{,}\) there is one and only one value possible for \(a_{n-1}\text{.}\) Then \(a_k\) is uniquely determined by \(a_k=f(a_{k-1}\text{.}\) Thus the truth of the statement that \(a_{k-1}\) is uniquely determined by the equations \(a_0=a\) and \(a_n=f(a_{n-1})\) implies the truth of the statement that \(a_k\) is determined uniquely by the equations \(a_0=a\) and \(a_n=f(a_{n-1})\text{.}\) Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(a_k\) is uniquely determined by the equations \(a_0=a\) and \(a_n=f(a_{n-1})\) for all nonnegative integers \(k\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_induction-recurrence.html#solution-160">in-context</a></span>
