<p>Suppose we make a necklace by stringing 12 pieces of brightly colored plastic tubing onto a string and fastening the ends of the string together. We have ample supplies blue, green, red, and yellow tubing available. Give a generating function in which the coefficient of \(B^iG^jR^kY^h\) is the number of necklaces we can make with \(i\) blues, \(j\) greens, \(k\) reds, and \(h\) yellows. How many terms would this generating function have if you expanded it in terms of powers of \(B\text{,}\) \(G\text{,}\) \(R\text{,}\) and \(Y\text{?}\) Does it make sense to do this expansion? How many of these necklaces have 3 blues, 3 greens, 2 reds, and 4 yellows?</p>
