<p>Start with vertex 1 and no edges as a graph \(H\text{.}\) Take an edge from it to another vertex. Add that edge and vertex to \(H\text{.}\) Now take an edge from one of the vertices you currently have to yet another vertex of the original graph. Add that vertex and edge to \(H\text{.}\) Repeat this process until you can find no such edge. You will get a tree because each edge you add connects a vertex of degree 1 to a tree you have already constructed. Since the original graph is connected, there must always be an edge from the current set of vertices you are considering to something not in that set.</p>
