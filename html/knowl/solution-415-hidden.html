<body><span class="solution"><p>Color an arbitrary vertex; you have \(x\) choices for the color of that vertex. No two vertices adjacent to it are adjacent (otherwise we'd have a cycle), so for for each of them you have \(x-1\) choices of colors. No two vertices adjacent to colored vertices are adjacent to each other, nor is one of them adjacent to two colored vertices (in either case you'd have a cycle), so for each of them you'd have \(x-1\) colors. You can continue this argument until all vertices are colored, so you have \(x(x-1)^{n-1}\) ways to color the vertices.</p>
<p>You can also prove by induction that the chromatic polynomial of a tree is \(x(x-1)^{n-1}\text{.}\) This is clearly true if there is one vertex. Otherwise, choose a vertex of degree 1 in an \(n\)-vertex tree and remove it. You may inductively assume that the chromatic polynomial of the remaining tree is \(x(x-1)^{n-2}\text{.}\) Now there are \(x-1\) choices for the color of the vertex you removed since it has degree 1, and so the chromatic polynomial of the tree is \(x(x-1)^{n-1}\text{.}\) There is also an inductive argument in which you delete and contract an arbitrary edge.</p></span></body>
