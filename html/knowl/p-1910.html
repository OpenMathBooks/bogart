<p>Now suppose again we are choosing three distinct flavors of ice cream out of four, but instead of putting scoops in a cone or choosing pints, we are going to have the three scoops arranged symmetrically in a circular dish. Similarly to choosing three pints, we can describe a selection of ice cream in terms of which one goes in the dish first, which one goes in second (say to the right of the first), and which one goes in third (say to the right of the second scoop, which makes it to the left of the first scoop). But again, two of these lists will sometimes be equivalent. Once they are in the dish, we can't tell which one went in first. However, there is a subtle difference between putting each flavor in its own small dish and putting all three flavors in a circle in a larger dish. Think about what makes the lists of flavors equivalent, and draw the directed graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three of the flavors of ice cream and whose edges connect two lists that we cannot tell the difference between as dishes of ice cream. How many dishes of ice cream can we distinguish from one another?</p>
