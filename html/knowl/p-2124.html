<p>Every involution is a unique product of disjoint two-cycles and one-cycles, so we can think of it as an ordered pair of whose first entry is a set of disjoint two-cycles and whose second element is a set of disjoint one-cycles. The value of a set of two-cycles is the union of their support sets and the value of a set of one-cycles is the union of their support sets. Then the EGF for involutions is the product of the EGF for permutations that are the product of only disjoint two-cycles and the EGF for permutations that are the product of only disjoint one-cycles (i.e. identity permutations).</p>
