<p>There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our base step was the case \(n=0\text{,}\) or in other words, we had \(b=0\text{.}\) However, in other proofs, \(b\) could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement for \(n=k\) required that \(k\) be at least 1, so that there would be an element \(a_k\) we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However, condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires that we be able to prove the implication for \(k&gt;0\text{,}\) so we were allowed to assume \(k&gt;0\text{.}\)</p>
