<p>Write down a list of all 16 zero-one sequences of length four starting with 0000 in such a way that each entry differs from the precious one by changing just one digit.  This is called a Gray Code. That is, a <em class="terminology">Gray Code</em> for 0-1 sequences of length \(n\) is a list of the sequences so that each entry differs from the previous one in exactly one place.  Can you describe how to get a Gray Code for 0-1 sequences of length five from the one you found for sequences of length 4?  Can you describe how to prove that there is a Gray code for sequences of length \(n\text{?}\)</p>
