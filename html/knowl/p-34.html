<p>The coach of the team in <a knowl="./knowl/basicsandwiches.html" knowl-id="xref-basicsandwiches" alt="Problem 3 " title="Problem 3 ">ProblemÂ 3</a> knows of an ice cream parlor along the way where she plans to stop to buy each team member a triple decker cone. There are 12 different flavors of ice cream, and triple decker cones are made in homemade waffle cones. Having chocolate ice cream as the bottom scoop is different from having chocolate ice cream as the top scoop. How many possible ice cream cones are going to be available to the team members? How many cones with three different kinds of ice cream will be available?</p>
