<p>You'll notice that in our formal statement of the sum and product pinciple we talked about a partition of a finite set. We could modify our language a bit to cover infinite sizes, but whenever we talk about sizes of sets in what follows, we will be working with finite sets. So as to avoid possible complications in the future, let us agree that when we refer to the size of a set, we are implicitly assuming the set is finite. There is another version of the product principle that applies directly in problems like <a knowl="./knowl/completelunch.html" knowl-id="xref-completelunch" alt="Problem 5 " title="Problem 5 ">Problem 5</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem 6</a>, where we were not just taking a union of \(m\) disjoint sets of size \(n\text{,}\) but rather \(m\) disjoint sets of size \(n\text{,}\) each of which was a union of \(m'\) disjoint sets of size \(n'\text{.}\) This is an inconvenient way to have to think about a counting problem, so we may rephrase the product principle in terms of a sequence of decisions:</p>
