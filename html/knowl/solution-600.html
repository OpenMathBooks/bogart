<p>We note that \(1=2^0\text{,}\) so 1 is a power of a prime. Now suppose that all positive numbers less than \(n\) are primes, powers of primes, or products of powers of primes. If \(n\) has no proper factors, it is a prime.  If it does have proper factors, say \(n=mk\text{,}\) both factors are less than \(n\) and greater than 1. Therefore each factor is a prime, a power of a prime, or a product of powers of primes. When we multiply \(m\) and \(k\) together, the result will still be a power of a prime or a product of powers of primes. Thus the statement that all positive numbers less than \(n\) are primes, powers of primes, or products of powers of primes implies the statement that \(n\) is a prime, a power of a prime, or a product of powers of primes. Therefore by the strong principle of mathematical induction, all positive numbers are either primes, powers of primes, or products of powers of primes.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="Induction.html#solution-600">in-context</a></span>
