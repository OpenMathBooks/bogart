<body><span class="solution"><p>To compute the orbit enumerator of \(G\) acting on functions from \(S\) to a finite set \(T\text{,}\) we substitute \(\sum_{t:t\in T}t^i\) for \(z_i\) in the cycle index for \(G\) acting on \(S\text{.}\) Here is the proof. By the Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem, we need to sum the fixed point enumerators of the permutations in \(G\text{.}\) However if \(\sigma\) fixes a coloring \((S,f)\text{,}\) then \(f\) is constant on the cycles of \(\sigma\text{.}\) Thus we may think of our function \(f\) as a function defined on the cycles of \(\sigma\text{.}\) If an \(i\)-cycle is colored by the member \(t\) of \(T\text{,}\) then the picture of the restriction of our coloring to that cycle is \(t^i\text{.}\) The picture enumerator for all colorings defined and constant on that cycle is then \(\sum_{t:t\in T} t^i\text{.}\) By <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-PictureEnumeratorforFunctions" alt="Problem 313 " title="Problem 313 ">Problem 313</a> the picture enumerator for all functions constant on the cycles of \(\sigma\text{,}\) then, is the result of substituting \(\sum_{t:t\in T}t^i\) for \(z_i\) in \(z(\sigma)\text{.}\) This proves the Pólya-Redfield Theorem.</p></span></body>
