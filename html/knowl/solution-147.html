<p>We want to prove that if \(m\ge 2\) and \(n\ge 2\text{,}\) then when there are \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) people in a room, there are either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers. If \(m+n=4\text{,}\) then \(m=2\) and \(n=2\text{,}\) and if there are \(\binom{2+2-2}{1}=2\) people in a room, there are either two who know each other or two who don't.</p>
<p>Now assume that when \(m+n=k-1\text{,}\) it is the case that if there are \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) people in a room, then there are either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers. Suppose that \(m'+n'=k\) and there are \(\binom{m'+n'-2}{m'-1}\) people in a room. If \(n'=2\text{,}\) then we know that with \(\binom{m'+2-2}{m'-1}=m'\) people in a room, there are either \(m'\) mutual acquaintances or two mutual strangers, and similarly if \(m'=2\) there are either two mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers among \(\binom{m'+n'-2}{m-1}\) people. Thus we may assume that both \(m'\) and \(n'\) are greater than two. Since \(\binom{m'+n'-2}{m-1}=
\binom{(m'-1)+n-2}{m'-2} +\binom{m+(n-1) -2}{m-1}\text{,}\) if there are \(\binom{m'+n'-2}{m'-1}\) people in a room, then a given person, say person \(P\text{,}\) is either acquainted with \(\binom{(m'-1)+n'-2}{m'-1}\) of them (call this case 1) or is a stranger with \(\binom{m'+(n-1)-2}{m-1}\) of them (call this case 2). Notice that \(m'-1+n'=k-1\) and \(m'+n'-1=k-1\text{.}\) Thus in case 1, our inductive hypothesis tells us that either \(m'-1\) of person \(P\)'s acquaintances are mutually acquainted, in which case they and person \(P\) form \(m'\) mutual acquaintances, or \(n'\) of \(P\)'s acquaintances are mutual strangers, in which case we have \(n'\) mutual strangers. Similarly in case 2 we have either \(m'\) mutual acquaintances or \(n'\) mutual strangers. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, for all values of \(m+n\) greater than or equal to 4, if we have \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) people in a room, then we have either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, so that \(R(m,n)\) exists and is no more than \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_induction-examples.html#solution-147">in-context</a></span>
