<p>There is one labelled tree on two vertices. We know there are three labelled trees on three vertices, and they all are paths. The difference among them is which vertex is the central vertex on the path. On four vertices a tree either has a vertex of degree 3 (there are four such trees) or it is a path, in which case there are six choices for the two vertices of degree 2, and for each choice of these two vertices, there are two different ways to attach the remaining vertices to them as vertices of degree 1. Thus there are \(12+4=16\) trees on four vertices. Assuming this is not enough data for a good guess, note that on five vertices, we either have a vertex of degree 4 (there are five such trees), or we have a vertex of degree three which must be adjacent to a vertex of degree two in order to have five vertices. There are \(5\cdot4=20\) ways to choose these two vertices; then three more choices we can make for the degree one vertex attached to the degree 2 vertex. Thus we have 60 trees with a vertex of degree three. If we have neither a vertex of degree four nor a vertex of degree three, then the tree is a path. We have \(\binom{5}{2}=10\) ways to choose the two vertices of degree one, and then there are \(3!=6\) ways to arrange the remaining vertices along the path, so we have 60 paths. Thus we have \(125\) trees on five vertices. These computations suggest there are \(n^{n-2}\) labelled trees on \(n\) vertices.</p>
