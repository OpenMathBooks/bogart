<p>The central core of mathematical induction is the proof that the truth of a statement about the integer \(n\) for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of the statement for \(n=k\text{.}\) For example, once we know that a set of size 0 has \(2^0\) subsets, if we have proved our implication, we can then conclude that a set of size 1 has \(2^1\) subsets, from which we can conclude that a set of size 2 has \(2^2\) subsets, from which we can conclude that a set of size 3 has \(2^3\) subsets, and so on up to a set of size \(n\) having \(2^n\) subsets for any nonnegative integer \(n\) we choose. In other words, although it was the idea of proof by contradiction that led us to think about such an implication, we can now do without the contradiction at all. What we need to prove a statement about \(n\) by this method is a place to start, that is a value \(b\) of \(n\) for which we know the statement to be true, and then a proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of the statement for \(n=k\) whenever \(k&gt;b\text{.}\)</p>
