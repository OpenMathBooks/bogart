<p>It makes sense to write the polynomial \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\text{;}\) this is simply a polynomial of degree \(k\) in the variable \(x\text{.}\) The expression \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) is also a polynomial in \(x\text{,}\) but it might not be of degree \(k\) since we are subtracting a degree \(k\) term from a degree \(k\) polynomial. In fact for every positive integer value \(n\) of \(x\text{,}\) this polynomial is zero. That is, \(\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-n^k=0\text{,}\) which is just a restatement of  <a knowl="./knowl/changeupperlimit.html" knowl-id="xref-changeupperlimit" alt="Equation 3.1 " title="Equation 3.1 ">EquationÂ (3.1)</a>. But it is a fact of algebra that the number of solutions of a nontrivial polynomial equation is no more than the degree of the polynomial. Since the polynomial equation \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) has infinitely many different solutions, it must be a trivial equation; that is \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) must be zero for every real (and even every complex) number \(x\text{.}\) Thus \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=x^k\text{,}\) and we have expressed \(x^k\) in terms of \(x^{\underline{j}}\) for \(j\le k\text{.}\)</p>
