<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" knowl-id="xref-fourchoosethree" alt="Problem 344 " title="Problem 344 ">Problems 344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" knowl-id="xref-icecreaminadish" alt="Problem 345 " title="Problem 345 ">Problem 345</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" knowl-id="xref-roundtable" alt="Problem 38 " title="Problem 38 ">Problem 38</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/necklace.html" knowl-id="xref-necklace" alt="Problem 43 " title="Problem 43 ">Problem 43</a> what we were doing in each case was counting equivalence classes of an equivalence relation. There was a special structure to the problems that made this somewhat easier to do. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" knowl-id="xref-fourchoosethree" alt="Problem 344 " title="Problem 344 ">Problem 344</a>, we had \(4\cdot3\cdot2 =24\) lists of three distinct flavors chosen from V, C, S, and P. Each list was equivalent to \(3\cdot2\cdot1=3!=6\) lists, including itself, from the point of view of serving 3 small dishes of ice cream. The order in which we selected the three flavors was unimportant. Thus the set of all \(4\cdot3\cdot2\) lists was a union of some number \(n\) of equivalence classes, each of size 6. By the product principle, if we have a union of \(n\) disjoint sets, each of size 6, the union has \(6n\) elements. But we already knew that the union was the set of all 24 lists of three distinct letters chosen from our four letters. Thus we have \(6n=24\text{,}\) or \(n=4\) equivalence classes.</p>
