<li><p>In paying off a mortgage loan with initial amount \(A\text{,}\) annual interest rate \(p\)% on a monthly basis with a monthly payment of \(m\text{,}\) what recurrence describes the amount owed after \(n\) months of payments in terms of the amount owed after \(n-1\) months?  Some technical details: You make the first payment after one month.  The amount of interest included in your monthly payment is \(.01p/12\text{.}\)  This interest rate is applied to the amount you owed immediately after making your last monthly payment.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a formula for the amount owed after \(n\) months.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a formula for the number of months needed to bring the amount owed to zero.  Another technical point: If you were to make the standard monthly payment \(m\) in the last month, you might actually end up owing a negative amount of money.  Therefore it is ok if the result of your formula for the number of months needed gives a non-integer number of months.  The bank would just round up to the next integer and adjust your payment so your balance comes out to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>What should the monthly payment be to pay off the loan over a period of 30 years?</p></li>
