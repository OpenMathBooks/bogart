<p id="p-1827">Consider the functions from \(S=\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}\) to \(T=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) defined by \(f(x) = x+3\text{,}\) and \(g(x) = x^5-5x^3+5x +3\text{.}\) Write down the set of ordered pairs \((x,f(x))\) for \(x \in S\) and the set of ordered pairs \((x,g(x))\) for \(x \in S\text{.}\) Are the two functions the same or different?</p></article><p id="p-1829"><a knowl="./knowl/functionsasorderedpairs.html" knowl-id="xref-functionsasorderedpairs" alt="Problem 328 " title="Problem 328 ">Problem¬†328</a> points out how two functions which appear to be different are actually the same on some domain of interest to us. Most of the time when we are thinking about functions it is fine to think of a function casually as a relationship between two sets. In <a knowl="./knowl/functionsasorderedpairs.html" knowl-id="xref-functionsasorderedpairs" alt="Problem 328 " title="Problem 328 ">Problem¬†328</a> the set of ordered pairs you wrote down for each function is called the <em class="terminology">relation</em> of the function. When we want to distinguish between the casual and the careful in talking about relationships, our casual term will be ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù and our careful term will be ‚Äúrelation.‚Äù So <!--Style me with CSS--><em>relation</em> is a technical word in mathematics, and as such it has a technical definition. A <em class="terminology">relation</em> from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a set of ordered pairs whose first elements are in \(S\) and whose second elements are in \(T\text{.}\) Another way to say this is that a <em class="terminology">relation</em> from \(S\) to \(T\) is a subset of \(S\times T\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-1830">A typical way to define a <em class="terminology">function</em> \(f\) from a set \(S\text{,}\) called the <em class="terminology">domain</em> of the function,  to a set \(T\text{,}\) called the <em class="terminology">range</em>,  is that \(f\) is a relationship between \(S\) to \(T\) that relates one and only one member of \(T\) to each element of \(X\text{.}\) We use \(f(x)\) to stand for the element of \(T\) that is related to the element \(x\) of \(S\text{.}\) If we wanted to make our definition more precise, we could substitute the word ‚Äúrelation‚Äù for the word ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù and we would have a more precise definition. For our purposes, you can choose whichever definition you prefer. However, in any case, there is a relation associated with each function. As we said above, the relation of a function \(f:
S\rightarrow T\) (which is the standard shorthand for ‚Äú\(f\) is a function from \(S\) to \(T\)‚Äù and is usually read as \(f\) <em class="terminology">maps</em> \(S\) to \(T\)) is the set of all ordered pairs \((x,f(x))\) such that \(x\) is in \(S\text{.}\)</p>

</h1></header><p id="p-1907">So far we've used relations primarily to talk about functions. There is another kind of relation, called an equivalence relation, that comes up in the counting problems with which we began. In <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminpints.html" knowl-id="xref-icecreaminpints" alt="Problem 8 " title="Problem 8 ">Problem¬†8</a> with three distinct flavors, it was probably tempting to say there are 12 flavors for the first pint, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, so there are \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) ways to choose the pints of ice cream. However, once the pints have been chosen, bought, and put into a bag, there is no way to tell which is first, which is second and which is third. What we just counted is lists of three distinct flavors‚Äîone to one functions from the set \(\{1,2,3\}\) in to the set of ice cream flavors. Two of those lists become equivalent once the ice cream purchase is made if they list the same ice cream. In other words, two of those lists become equivalent (are related) if they list same subset of the set of ice cream flavors. To visualize this relation with a digraph, we would need one vertex for each of the \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) lists. Even with five flavors of ice cream, we would need one vertex for each of \(5\cdot4\cdot3=60\) lists. So for now we will work with the easier to draw question of choosing three pints of ice cream of different flavors from four flavors of ice cream.</p>

<p id="p-1910">Now suppose again we are choosing three distinct flavors of ice cream out of four, but instead of putting scoops in a cone or choosing pints, we are going to have the three scoops arranged symmetrically in a circular dish. Similarly to choosing three pints, we can describe a selection of ice cream in terms of which one goes in the dish first, which one goes in second (say to the right of the first), and which one goes in third (say to the right of the second scoop, which makes it to the left of the first scoop). But again, two of these lists will sometimes be equivalent. Once they are in the dish, we can't tell which one went in first. However, there is a subtle difference between putting each flavor in its own small dish and putting all three flavors in a circle in a larger dish. Think about what makes the lists of flavors equivalent, and draw the directed graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three of the flavors of ice cream and whose edges connect two lists that we cannot tell the difference between as dishes of ice cream. How many dishes of ice cream can we distinguish from one another?</p>

Technically, you should have had an arrow from each vertex (list) to itself. This is what we mean when we say a relation is <em class="terminology">reflexive</em>.

<p id="p-1921">After some more examples, we will see how to show that equivalence relations have the kind of clumping property you saw in the directed graphs. In our first example, using the notation \((a,b) \in R\) to say that \(a\) is related to \(B\) is going to get in the way. It is really more common to write \(a
R b\) to mean that \(a\) is related to \(b\text{.}\) For example, if our relation is the less than relation on \(\{1,2,3\}\text{,}\) you are much more likely to use \(x\lt y\) than you are \((x,y)\in \ \lt\text{,}\) aren't you? The reflexive law then says \(xRx\) for every \(x\) in \(X\text{,}\) the symmetric law says that if \(xRy\text{,}\) then \(yRx\text{,}\) and the transitive law says that if \(xRy\) and \(yRz\text{,}\) then \(xRz\text{.}\)</p>

<p id="p-1946">A relation \(R\) is an equivalence relation on a set \(S\) if and only if \(S\) may be partitioned into sets \(S_1\text{,}\) \(S_2\text{,}\) ‚Ä¶, \(S_n\) in such a way that \(x\) and \(y\) are related by \(R\) if and only if they are in the same block \(S_i\) of the partition. </p></article><p id="p-1947">In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" knowl-id="xref-fourchoosethree" alt="Problem 344 " title="Problem 344 ">Problems¬†344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" knowl-id="xref-icecreaminadish" alt="Problem 345 " title="Problem 345 ">Problem¬†345</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" knowl-id="xref-roundtable" alt="Problem 38 " title="Problem 38 ">Problem¬†38</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/necklace.html" knowl-id="xref-necklace" alt="Problem 43 " title="Problem 43 ">Problem¬†43</a> what we were doing in each case was counting equivalence classes of an equivalence relation. There was a special structure to the problems that made this somewhat easier to do. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" knowl-id="xref-fourchoosethree" alt="Problem 344 " title="Problem 344 ">Problem¬†344</a>, we had \(4\cdot3\cdot2 =24\) lists of three distinct flavors chosen from V, C, S, and P. Each list was equivalent to \(3\cdot2\cdot1=3!=6\) lists, including itself, from the point of view of serving 3 small dishes of ice cream. The order in which we selected the three flavors was unimportant. Thus the set of all \(4\cdot3\cdot2\) lists was a union of some number \(n\) of equivalence classes, each of size 6. By the product principle, if we have a union of \(n\) disjoint sets, each of size 6, the union has \(6n\) elements. But we already knew that the union was the set of all 24 lists of three distinct letters chosen from our four letters. Thus we have \(6n=24\text{,}\) or \(n=4\) equivalence classes.</p>
<p id="p-1948">In <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" knowl-id="xref-icecreaminadish" alt="Problem 345 " title="Problem 345 ">Problem¬†345</a> there is a subtle change. In the language we adopted for seating people around a round table, if we choose the flavors V, C, and S, and arrange them in the dish with C to the right of V and S to the right of C, then the scoops are in different relative positions than if we arrange them instead with S to the right of V and C to the right of S. Thus the order in which the scoops go into the dish is somewhat important‚Äîsomewhat, because putting in V first, then C to its right and S to its right is the same as putting in S first, then V to its right and C to its right. In this case, each list of three flavors is equivalent to only three lists, including itself, and so if there are \(n\) equivalence classes, we have \(3n=24\text{,}\) so there are \(24/3=8\) equivalence classes.</p>
