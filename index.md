This is a new release of *Combinatorics through Guided Discovery* by Kenneth P. Bogart.  The content is nearly identical to the [2004 release](https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/), save for a few typographical corrections.  The main addition here is the availability of a [web verion](./ctgd/).  There is also a new [pdf version](./pdf/bogart.pdf).

The source is also available in PreTeXt.  Development of the project continues on [github](https://github.com/OpenDiscreteMath/ibl-combinatorics).
