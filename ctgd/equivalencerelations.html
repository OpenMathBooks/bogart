<a href="equivalencerelations.html" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-1924">So far we've used relations primarily to talk about functions. There is another kind of relation, called an equivalence relation, that comes up in the counting problems with which we began. In <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminpints.html" title="Problem 8">Problem¬†8</a> with three distinct flavors, it was probably tempting to say there are 12 flavors for the first pint, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, so there are \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) ways to choose the pints of ice cream. However, once the pints have been chosen, bought, and put into a bag, there is no way to tell which is first, which is second and which is third. What we just counted is lists of three distinct flavors‚Äîone to one functions from the set \(\{1,2,3\}\) in to the set of ice cream flavors. Two of those lists become equivalent once the ice cream purchase is made if they list the same ice cream. In other words, two of those lists become equivalent (are related) if they list same subset of the set of ice cream flavors. To visualize this relation with a digraph, we would need one vertex for each of the \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) lists. Even with five flavors of ice cream, we would need one vertex for each of \(5\cdot4\cdot3=60\) lists. So for now we will work with the easier to draw question of choosing three pints of ice cream of different flavors from four flavors of ice cream.</p>

<p id="p-1925">Suppose we have four flavors of ice cream, V(anilla), C(hocolate), S(trawberry) and P(each). Draw the directed graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three distinct flavors of the ice cream, and whose edges connect two lists if they list the same three flavors. This graph makes it pretty clear in how many ways we may choose 3 flavors out of four. How many is it?</p></article><article class="example-like interesting" id="icecreaminadish"><h6 class="heading">

<p id="p-1927">Now suppose again we are choosing three distinct flavors of ice cream out of four, but instead of putting scoops in a cone or choosing pints, we are going to have the three scoops arranged symmetrically in a circular dish. Similarly to choosing three pints, we can describe a selection of ice cream in terms of which one goes in the dish first, which one goes in second (say to the right of the first), and which one goes in third (say to the right of the second scoop, which makes it to the left of the first scoop). But again, two of these lists will sometimes be equivalent. Once they are in the dish, we can't tell which one went in first. However, there is a subtle difference between putting each flavor in its own small dish and putting all three flavors in a circle in a larger dish. Think about what makes the lists of flavors equivalent, and draw the directed graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three of the flavors of ice cream and whose edges connect two lists that we cannot tell the difference between as dishes of ice cream. How many dishes of ice cream can we distinguish from one another?</p>

<p id="p-1930">Draw the digraph for <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Problem 38">Problem¬†38</a> in the special case where we have four people sitting around the table.</p></article><p id="p-1931">In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems¬†344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">345</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" title="Problem 346">346</a> (as well as <a knowl="./knowl/twelvechoosethree.html" title="Problem 34">Problems¬†34</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Problem 38">38</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosek.html" title="Problem 39">39</a>) we can begin with a set of lists, and say when two lists are equivalent as representations of the objects we are trying to count. In particular, in <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems¬†344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">345</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" title="Problem 346">346</a> you drew the directed graph for this relation of equivalence. Technically, you should have had an arrow from each vertex (list) to itself. This is what we mean when we say a relation is <dfn class="terminology">reflexive</dfn>. Whenever you had an arrow from one vertex to a second, you had an arrow back to the first. This is what we mean when we say a relation is <dfn class="terminology">symmetric</dfn>.</p>
<p id="p-1932">When people sit around a round table, each list is equivalent to itself: if List1 and List 2 are identical, then everyone has the same person to the right in both lists (including the first person in the list being to the right of the last person). To see the symmetric property of the equivalence of seating arrangements, if List1 and List2 are different, but everyone has the same person to the right when they sit according to List2 as when they sit according to List1, then everybody better have the same person to the right when they sit according to List1 as when they sit according to List2.</p>
<p id="p-1933">In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems¬†344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">345</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" title="Problem 346">346</a> there is another property of those relations you may have noticed from the directed graph. Whenever you had an arrow from \(L_1\) to \(L_2\) and an arrow from \(L_2\) to \(L_3\text{,}\) then there was an arrow from \(L_1\) to \(L_3\text{.}\) This is what we mean when we say a relation is <dfn class="terminology">transitive</dfn>. You also undoubtedly noticed how the directed graph divides up into clumps of mutually connected vertices. This is what equivalence relations are all about. Let's be a bit more precise in our description of what it means for a relation to be reflexive, symmetric or transitive. </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-129"><p id="p-1934">If \(R\) is a relation on a set \(X\text{,}\) we say \(R\) is <dfn class="terminology">reflexive</dfn>  if \((x,x)\in

<li id="li-130"><p id="p-1935">If \(R\) is a relation on a set \(X\text{,}\) we say \(R\) is <dfn class="terminology">symmetric</dfn> if \((x,y)\) is in \(R\) whenever \((y,x)\) is in \(R\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-131"><p id="p-1936">If \(R\) is a relation on a set \(X\text{,}\) we say \(R\) is <dfn class="terminology">transitive</dfn> if whenever \((x,y)\) is in \(R\) and \((y,z)\) is in \(R\text{,}\) then \((x,z)\) is in \(R\) as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-1937">Each of the relations of equivalence you worked with in <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems¬†344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">345</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" title="Problem 346">346</a> had these three properties. Can you visualize the same three properties in the relations of equivalence that you would use in <a knowl="./knowl/twelvechoosethree.html" title="Problem 34">Problems¬†34</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Problem 38">38</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosek.html" title="Problem 39">39</a>? We call a relation an <dfn class="terminology">equivalence relation</dfn> if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.</p>
<p id="p-1938">After some more examples, we will see how to show that equivalence relations have the kind of clumping property you saw in the directed graphs. In our first example, using the notation \((a,b) \in R\) to say that \(a\) is related to \(B\) is going to get in the way. It is really more common to write \(a
R b\) to mean that \(a\) is related to \(b\text{.}\) For example, if our relation is the less than relation on \(\{1,2,3\}\text{,}\) you are much more likely to use \(x\lt y\) than you are \((x,y)\in \ \lt\text{,}\) aren't you? The reflexive law then says \(xRx\) for every \(x\) in \(X\text{,}\) the symmetric law says that if \(xRy\text{,}\) then \(yRx\text{,}\) and the transitive law says that if \(xRy\) and \(yRz\text{,}\) then \(xRz\text{.}\)</p>

<p id="p-1963">A relation \(R\) is an equivalence relation on a set \(S\) if and only if \(S\) may be partitioned into sets \(S_1\text{,}\) \(S_2\text{,}\) ‚Ä¶, \(S_n\) in such a way that \(x\) and \(y\) are related by \(R\) if and only if they are in the same block \(S_i\) of the partition. </p></article><p id="p-1964">In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems¬†344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">Problem¬†345</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Problem 38">Problem¬†38</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/necklace.html" title="Problem 43">Problem¬†43</a> what we were doing in each case was counting equivalence classes of an equivalence relation. There was a special structure to the problems that made this somewhat easier to do. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problem¬†344</a>, we had \(4\cdot3\cdot2 =24\) lists of three distinct flavors chosen from V, C, S, and P. Each list was equivalent to \(3\cdot2\cdot1=3!=6\) lists, including itself, from the point of view of serving 3 small dishes of ice cream. The order in which we selected the three flavors was unimportant. Thus the set of all \(4\cdot3\cdot2\) lists was a union of some number \(n\) of equivalence classes, each of size 6. By the product principle, if we have a union of \(n\) disjoint sets, each of size 6, the union has \(6n\) elements. But we already knew that the union was the set of all 24 lists of three distinct letters chosen from our four letters. Thus we have \(6n=24\text{,}\) or \(n=4\) equivalence classes.</p>
<p id="p-1965">In <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">Problem¬†345</a> there is a subtle change. In the language we adopted for seating people around a round table, if we choose the flavors V, C, and S, and arrange them in the dish with C to the right of V and S to the right of C, then the scoops are in different relative positions than if we arrange them instead with S to the right of V and C to the right of S. Thus the order in which the scoops go into the dish is somewhat important‚Äîsomewhat, because putting in V first, then C to its right and S to its right is the same as putting in S first, then V to its right and C to its right. In this case, each list of three flavors is equivalent to only three lists, including itself, and so if there are \(n\) equivalence classes, we have \(3n=24\text{,}\) so there are \(24/3=8\) equivalence classes.</p>
