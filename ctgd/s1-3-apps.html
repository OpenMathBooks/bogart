<p id="p-305">We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block \(B_i\) for each \(i\) between \(1\) and \(n\text{.}\)  For now, suppose the value of \(i\text{,}\) while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece \(F\) (for ‚Äúfront‚Äù) consists of all steps before the \(i\)th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece \(U\) (for ‚Äúup‚Äù) consists of the \(i\)th upstep.  The piece \(B\) (for ‚Äúback‚Äù) is the portion of the path that follows the \(i\)th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as \(FUB\text{.}\)  Show that the function that takes \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block \(B_i\) of the partition.

Suppose that \(i = 5\text{.}\) The fifth upstep is the \(u\) in position 9. Thus \(F = uudduudd\text{,}\) \(U = u\text{,}\) and \(B = dud\text{.}\) Now \(BU F\) is \(duduuudduudd\text{.}\) This is a Dyck path that begins by going below the \(x\)-axis. The \(d\)'s in positions 1 and 3 take the path to the \(y\)-coordinate \(-1\text{.}\) Then the \(y\) coordinate climbs to 2, goes back to 0, up to 2 again, and finally down to 0. So the absolute minimum is \(-1\text{,}\) and it occurs in the first and third position. There are five \(u\)'s after the third positon. So this Dyck path is in the block \(B_5\) of our partition. Now comes the crucial question. Why were there five u's after that last absolute minimum in position 3? Try with the same path and \(i = 3\text{.}\) Figure out why there are three u's after the last absolute minimum in the resulting path. All this discussion should explain why when \(i = 5\text{,}\) the set of all Catalan paths is mapped into the set \(B_5\text{.}\) Keeping \(i = 5\) for a while, try to see why this correspondence between Catalan paths and \(B_5\) is a bijection. Then, if you need to, do the same thing with \(i = 3\text{.}\) This should give you enough insight to do the general case.</p></span></span></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-64"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>

For example, you can partition the coins according to the last digit of their date; that is, you put all the coins with a given last digit in a block together, and put no other coins in that block; repeating until all coins are in some block. Then you have a partition of your set of coins. If no two coins have the same last digit, then each block has exactly one coin. Since there are only ten digits, there are at most ten blocks and so by the sum principle there are at most ten coins. In fact with ten coins it is possible to have no two with the same last digit, but with 11 coins some block must have at least two coins in order for the sum of the sizes of at most ten blocks to be 11.

Another way to say the same thing is to say that six is the smallest number so that no matter how we connect 6 points in the plane (no three on a line) with red and green lines, we can find either a red triangle or a green triangle. There is a name for this property. The <em class="terminology">Ramsey Number</em> \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is a set of at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n\) mutual strangers. There is also a geometric description of Ramsey Numbers; it uses the idea of a <em class="terminology">complete graph</em> on \(R\) vertices. A <em class="terminology">complete graph</em> on \(R\) vertices consists of \(R\) points in the plane together with line segments (or curves) connecting each two of the \(R\) vertices.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-4" id="fn-4"><span class="footnote"><sup>‚Äâ4‚Äâ</sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-4" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">As you may have guessed, a complete graph is a special case of something called a graph.

The graph theory description of \(R(m,n)\) is that \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with red and green, then we can find in our picture either a \(K_m\) all of whose edges are red or a \(K_n\) all of whose edges are green. Because we could have said our colors in the opposite order, we may conclude that \(R(m,n) = R(n,m)\text{.}\) In particular \(R(n,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) such that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with two colors, then our picture contains a \(K_n\) all of whose edges have the same color.</p>

You will see that there are two things that can keep \(R(4, 4)\) from being 8. You need to figure out which one happens and explain why.
