<div class="introduction" id="introduction-4"><p id="p-50">The idea of a function is ubiquitous in mathematics. A function \(f\) from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a relationship between the two sets that associates exactly one member \(f(x)\) of \(T\) with each element \(x\) in \(S\text{.}\) We will come back to the ideas of functions and relationships in more detail and from different points of view from time to time. However, the quick review above should probably let you answer these questions. If you have difficulty with them, it would be a good idea to go now to <a href="Relations.html" class="xref" alt="Appendix A Relations" title="Appendix A Relations">Appendix¬†A</a> and work through <a href="relationsandfunctions.html" class="xref" alt="Section A.1 Relations as sets of Ordered Pairs" title="Section A.1 Relations as sets of Ordered Pairs">Section¬†A.1</a> which covers this definition in more detail.

For example, with luck, you just  stated the sum principle (illustrated in <a knowl="./knowl/sumprinc.html" knowl-id="xref-sumprinc" alt="Figure 1.2.1 " title="Figure 1.2.1 ">Figure¬†1.2.1</a>), and product principle (illustrated in <a knowl="./knowl/prodprinc.html" knowl-id="xref-prodprinc" alt="Figure 1.2.2 " title="Figure 1.2.2 ">Figure¬†1.2.2</a>) in <a knowl="./knowl/sum.html" knowl-id="xref-sum" alt="Problem 9 " title="Problem 9 ">Problems¬†9</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/product.html" knowl-id="xref-product" alt="Problem 10 " title="Problem 10 ">Problem¬†10</a>. These two counting principles are the basis on which we will develop many other counting principles.</p>

One of our goals in these notes is to show how most counting problems can be recognized as counting all or some of the elements of a set of standard mathematical objects. For example <a knowl="./knowl/orderedpair.html" knowl-id="xref-orderedpair" alt="Problem 4 " title="Problem 4 ">Problem¬†4</a> is meant to suggest that the question we asked in <a knowl="./knowl/basicsandwiches.html" knowl-id="xref-basicsandwiches" alt="Problem 3 " title="Problem 3 ">Problem¬†3</a> was really a problem of counting all the ordered pairs consisting of a bread choice and a filling choice. We use \(A\times B\) to stand for the set of all ordered pairs whose first element is in \(A\) and whose second element is in \(B\) and we call \(A\times B\) the <dfn class="terminology">Cartesian product</dfn> of \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) so you can think of <a knowl="./knowl/orderedpair.html" knowl-id="xref-orderedpair" alt="Problem 4 " title="Problem 4 ">Problem¬†4</a> as asking you for the size of the Cartesian product of \(M\) and \(N\text{,}\) that is, asking you to count the number of elements of this Cartesian product.</p>
<p id="p-79">When a set \(S\) is a union of disjoint sets \(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m\) we say that the sets \(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m\) are a <dfn class="terminology">partition</dfn> of the set \(S\text{.}\) Thus a partition of \(S\) is a (special kind of) set of sets. So that we don't find ourselves getting confused between the set \(S\) and the sets \(B_i\) into which we have divided it, we often call the sets \(B_1, B_2,
\ldots, B_m\) the <dfn class="terminology">blocks</dfn> of the partition. In this language, the <dfn class="terminology">sum principle</dfn> says that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-3"><p id="p-80">if we have a partition of a set \(S\text{,}\) then the size of \(S\) is the sum of the sizes of the blocks of the partition.</p></blockquote>
<p id="p-81">The <dfn class="terminology">product principle</dfn> says that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-4"><p id="p-82">if we have a partition of a set \(S\) into \(m\) blocks, each of size \(n\text{,}\) then \(S\) has size \(mn\text{.}\)</p></blockquote>
<p id="p-83">You'll notice that in our formal statement of the sum and product pinciple we talked about a partition of a finite set. We could modify our language a bit to cover infinite sizes, but whenever we talk about sizes of sets in what follows, we will be working with finite sets. So as to avoid possible complications in the future, let us agree that when we refer to the size of a set, we are implicitly assuming the set is finite. There is another version of the product principle that applies directly in problems like <a knowl="./knowl/completelunch.html" knowl-id="xref-completelunch" alt="Problem 5 " title="Problem 5 ">Problem¬†5</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem¬†6</a>, where we were not just taking a union of \(m\) disjoint sets of size \(n\text{,}\) but rather \(m\) disjoint sets of size \(n\text{,}\) each of which was a union of \(m'\) disjoint sets of size \(n'\text{.}\) This is an inconvenient way to have to think about a counting problem, so we may rephrase the product principle in terms of a sequence of decisions:</p>

<a href="s1-2-basics.html#subsection-2" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-126">As another example how standard mathematical language relates to counting problems, <a knowl="./knowl/countingfunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-countingfunctions" alt="Problem 7 " title="Problem 7 ">Problem¬†7</a> explicitly asked you to relate the idea of counting functions to the question of <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem¬†6</a>. You have probably learned in algebra or calculus how to draw graphs in the Cartesian plane of functions from a set of numbers to a set of numbers. You may recall how we can determine whether a graph is a graph of a function by examining whether each vertical straight line crosses the graph at most one time. You might also recall how we can determine whether such a function is one-to-one by examining whether each horizontal straight line crosses the graph at most one time. The functions we deal with will often involve objects which are not numbers, and will often be functions from one finite set to another. Thus graphs in the cartesian plane will often not be available to us for visualizing functions.</p>
<p id="p-127">However, there is another kind of graph called a <dfn class="terminology">directed graph</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">digraph</dfn> that is especially useful when dealing with functions between finite sets. We take up this topic in more detail in <a href="Relations.html" class="xref" alt="Appendix A Relations" title="Appendix A Relations">Appendix¬†A</a>, particularly <a href="relationsandfunctions.html#relationdigraph" class="xref" alt="Subsection A.1.2 Directed graphs" title="Subsection A.1.2 Directed graphs">Subsection¬†A.1.2</a> and <a href="relationsandfunctions.html#digraphsoffunctions" class="xref" alt="Subsection A.1.3 Digraphs of Functions" title="Subsection A.1.3 Digraphs of Functions">Subsection¬†A.1.3</a>. In <a knowl="./knowl/functiondigraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-functiondigraphs" alt="Figure 1.2.3 " title="Figure 1.2.3 ">Figure¬†1.2.3</a> we show several examples of digraphs of functions.</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="functiondigraphs"><img src="images/functiondigraph.svg" width="73%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">1.2.3</span>What is a digraph of a function?</figcaption></figure><p id="p-128">If we have a function \(f\) from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\text{,}\) we draw a line of dots or circles, called <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn> to represent the elements of \(S\) and another (usually parallel) line of circles or dots to represent the elements of \(T\text{.}\) We then draw an arrow from the circle for \(x\) to the circle for \(y\) if \(f(x) = y\text{.}\) Sometimes, as in part (e) of the figure, if we have a function from a set \(S\) to itself, we draw only one set of vertices representing the elements of \(S\text{,}\) in which case we can have arrows both entering and leaving a given vertex. As you see, the digraph can be more enlightening in this case if we experiment with the function to find a nice placement of the vertices rather than putting them in a row.</p>
<p id="p-129">Notice that there is a simple test for whether a digraph whose vertices represent the elements of the sets \(S\) and \(T\) is the digraph of a function from \(S\) to \(T\text{.}\) There must be one and only one arrow leaving each vertex of the digraph representing an element of \(S\text{.}\) The fact that there is one arrow means that \(f(x)\) is defined for each \(x\) in \(S\text{.}\) The fact that there is only one arrow means that each \(x\) in \(S\) is related to exactly one element of \(T\text{.}\) (Note that these remarks hold as well if we have a function from \(S\) to \(S\) and draw only one set of vertices representing the elements of \(S\text{.}\)) For further discussion of functions and digraphs see <a href="relationsandfunctions.html#functionrelation" class="xref" alt="Subsection A.1.1 The relation of a function" title="Subsection A.1.1 The relation of a function">Sections¬†A.1.1</a> and <a href="relationsandfunctions.html#relationdigraph" class="xref" alt="Subsection A.1.2 Directed graphs" title="Subsection A.1.2 Directed graphs">Subsection¬†A.1.2</a> of {<a href="Relations.html" class="xref" alt="Appendix A Relations" title="Appendix A Relations">Appendix¬†A</a>}.</p>

You may have seen a notation like \(\binom{n}{k}\text{,}\) \(C(n,k)\text{,}\) or \(_nC_k\) which stands for the number of ways to choose a \(k\)-element subset from an \(n\)-element set. The number \(\binom{n}{k}\) is read as ‚Äú\(n\) choose \(k\)‚Äù and is called a <dfn class="terminology">binomial coefficient</dfn> for reasons we will see later on. Another frequently used way to read the binomial coefficient notation is ``the number of combinations  of \(n\) things taken \(k\) at a time." You are going to be asked to construct two bijections that relate to these numbers and figure out what famous formula they prove. We are going to think about subsets of the \(n\)-element set \([n] =

</div></article><p id="p-171">It is less common to see Pascal's triangle as a right triangle, but it actually makes your formula easier to interpret. In Pascal's Right Triangle, the element in row \(n\) and column \(k\) (with the convention that the first row is row zero and the first column is column zero) is \(\binom{n}{k}\text{.}\) In this case your formula says each entry in a row is the sum of the one above and the one above and to the left, except for the leftmost and rightmost entries of a row, for which that doesn't make sense. Since the leftmost entry is \(\binom{n}{0}\) and the rightmost entry is \(\binom{n}{n}\text{,}\) these entries are both one (to see why, ask yourself how many \(0\)-element subsets and how many \(n\)-element subsets an \(n\)-element set has), and your formula then tells how to fill in the rest of the table.</p>

<p id="p-249">The quotient principle is really just a restatement of the product principle, but thinking about it as a principle in its own right often leads us to find solutions to problems. Notice that it does not always give us a formula for the number of blocks of a partition; it only works when all the blocks have the same size. In <a href="groupsonsets.html" class="xref" alt="Chapter 6 Groups acting on sets" title="Chapter 6 Groups acting on sets">Chapter¬†6</a>, we develop a way to solve problems with different block sizes in cases where there is a good deal of symmetry in the problem. (The roundness of the table was a symmetry in the problem of people at a table; the fact that we can order the sets in any order is the symmetry in the problem of counting \(k\)-element subsets.)</p>

<p id="p-267">While the formula you proved in <a knowl="./knowl/nchoosek.html" knowl-id="xref-nchoosek" alt="Problem 35 " title="Problem 35 ">Problems¬†35</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosekfinal.html" knowl-id="xref-formulanchoosekfinal" alt="Part 39.d " title="Part 39.d ">39.d</a> is very useful, it doesn't give us a sense of how big the binomial coefficients are. We can get a very rough idea, for example, of the size of \(\binom{2n}{n}\) by recognizing that we can write \((2n)^{\underline{n}}/n!\) as \(\frac{2n}{n}\cdot
\frac{2n-1}{n-1}\cdots \frac{n+1}{1}\text{,}\) and each quotient is at least \(2\text{,}\) so the product is at least \(2^n\text{.}\) If this were an accurate estimate, it would mean the fraction of \(n\)-element subsets of a \(2n\)-element set would be about         \(2^n/2^{2n}=1/2^n\text{,}\) which becomes very small as \(n\) becomes large. However it is pretty clear the approximation will not be a very good one, because some of the terms in that product are much larger than 2. In fact, if \(\binom{2n}{k}\) were the same for every \(k\text{,}\) then each would be the fraction \(\frac{1}{2n+1}\) of \(2^{2n}\text{.}\) This is much larger than the fraction \(\frac{1}{2^n}\text{.}\) But our intuition suggets that \(\binom{2n}{n}\) is much larger than \(\binom{2n}{1}\) and is likely larger than \(\binom{2n}{n-1}\) so we can be sure our approximation is a bad one. For estimates like this, James Stirling developed a formula to approximate \(n!\) when \(n\) is large, namely \(n!\) is about \(\left(\sqrt{2\pi
n}\right){n^n/ e^n}\text{.}\) In fact the ratio of \(n!\) to this expression approaches 1 as \(n\) becomes infinite.<span class="footnote"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><sup>‚Äâ2‚Äâ</sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-2" class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Proving this takes more of a detour than is advisable here; however there is an elementary proof which you can work through in the problems of the end of Section 1 of Chapter 1 of <em class="emphasis">Introductory Combinatorics</em> by Kenneth P.
