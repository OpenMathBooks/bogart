<p>First suppose that \(f\) is a one-to-one function from \(S\) to \(T\text{,}\) sets which have the same size. Let \(B_j=\{i|f(i)=j\}\) for each \(j\) in \(T\text{..}\)  If \(f\) is not onto, then the number of nonempty sets \(B_j\) is smaller than the number of elements of \(T\) and thus is smaller than the size of \(S\text{.}\) The nonempty sets \(B_j\) are a partition of \(S\text{.}\) But then by the pigeonhole principle, some nonempty \(B_j\) has two or more elements, contradicting the assumption that \(f\) is one-to-one. Therefore if \(f\) is one-to-one, then it is onto. Now suppose that \(f\) is an onto function from \(S\) to \(T\text{,}\) sets of the same size. Again let \(B_j =\{i|f(i)=j\}\) for each \(j\) in \(T\text{.}\) The size of the union of the sets \(B_j\) is, by the sum principle, the sum of their sizes. Since \(f\) is onto, each \(B_j\) has at least one element. Since the number of sets \(B_j\) is the number of elements of \(S\text{,}\) if one of those sets has more than one element, the the size of their union is more than the size of \(S\text{,}\) which is a contradiction since they are subsets of \(S\text{.}\) Therefore each set \(B_j\) has exactly one element and therefore \(f\) is one-to-one.</p>
