<p>Since \(B_1=B_2\text{,}\) these two sets are the same block, and thus all blocks containing \(v\) are identical, so \(v\) is in only one block. Thus we have a partition of the vertex set, and the blocks of the partition are the connected components of the graph. Notice that the connected components depend on the edge set of the graph. If we have a graph on the vertex set \(V\) with edge set \(E\) and another graph on the vertex set \(V\) with edge set \(E'\text{,}\) then these two graphs could have different connected components. It is traditional to use the Greek letter \(\gamma\) (gamma)<a knowl="./knowl/fn-18-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> to stand for the number of connected components of a graph; in particular, \(\gamma(V,E)\) stands for the number of connected components of the graph with vertex set \(V\) and edge set \(E\text{.}\) We are going to show how the principle of inclusion and exclusion may be used to compute the number of ways to properly color a graph using colors from a set \(C\) of \(c\) colors.</p>
