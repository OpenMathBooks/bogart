<p>The minimum is zero, which happens with a tree with one vertex. If the tree has more than one vertex, the minimum number of vertices of degree one is two. To prove this, we prove that every tree with two or more vertices has at least two vertices of degree two. Note that a tree with two vertices has exactly two vertices of degree 2. Now take a tree with more than two vertices. Remove an edge \(e\) without removing its endpoints. As in the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/Noverticesandedgesoftree.html" knowl-id="xref-Noverticesandedgesoftree" alt="Problem 108 " title="Problem 108 ">ProblemÂ 108</a> this gives two trees. We may assume inductively that each has at least two vertices of degree 1, or else is a single vertex. When we put \(e\) back in, it connects one vertex in one tree to one in the other. If both these vertices have degree 1 in their trees, there will be at least one vertex of degree 1 remaining in each tree, so there will be at least two vertices of degree 1 in the tree we get. If exactly one of these vertices is a tree with one vertex after the removal of \(e\text{,}\) when we connect it to the other tree, we will remove at most one increase the degree of at most one vertex of degree 1 and will create a new vertex of degree 1, so the tree that results still has at least two vertices of degree 1. Therefore by the strong principle of mathematical induction, every tree with more than two vertices has at least two vertices of degree 1. Since a two-vertex tree has two vertices of degree 1, the minimum number of vertices of degree 1 in a tree with two or more vertices is two. (In fact a path with \(n\) vertices is a tree and it has exactly two vertices of degree one also.)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_induction-graphstrees.html#solution-183">in-context</a></span>
