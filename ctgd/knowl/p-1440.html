<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/composition1.html" knowl-id="xref-composition1" alt="Problem 248 " title="Problem 248 ">ProblemÂ 248</a> you see that we can think of \(\rho^2\circ\rho\) as the result of first rotating by 90 degrees and then by another 180 degrees. In other words, the composition of two rotations is the same thing as first doing one and then doing the other. Of course there is nothing special about 90 degrees and 180 degrees.  As long as we first do one rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees and then another rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees, the composition of these rotations is a rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees.</p>
