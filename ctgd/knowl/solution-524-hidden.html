<body><span class="solution"><p>In the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/polya1.html" knowl-id="xref-polya1" alt="Problem 314 " title="Problem 314 ">Problem 314</a> we wrote: ``The picture enumerator of the two constant functions is \(R^6+B^6\text{.}\) If the vertices are numbered one through six clockwise, then \(\rho^2\) is \((1\ 3\ 5)(2\ 4\ 6)\text{.}\) Thus for a function \(f\) to be fixed by \(\rho^2\text{,}\) \(f(1)=f(3)=f(5)\) and \(f(2)=f(4)=f(6)\text{.}\) Thus the color of vertex 1 is repeated on vertex 3 and 5, and the color of vertex 2 is repeated on vertices 4 and 6. Therefore the picture enumerator for functions fixed by \(\rho^2\) and \(\rho^4\) is \(R^3R^3 +R^3B^3+B^3R^3 +B^3B^3=(R^3+B^3)^2\text{.}\) We can also think of this as the picture enumerator for functions defined on the cycles of the permutation. There are two possible pictures of a colored cycle, \(R^3\) and \(B^3\text{,}\) so the picture enumerator for one cycle is \(R^3+B^3\text{.}\) Thus the picture of assigning red to a cycle is \(R^3\) and the picture of assigning blue to a cycle is \(B^3\text{.}\) By <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-PictureEnumeratorforFunctions" alt="Problem 313 " title="Problem 313 ">Problem 313</a>, the picture enumerator for functions defined on the two cycles is then \((R^3+B^3)^2\text{.}\) If a function \(f\) is fixed by \(\rho^3=(1\ 4)(2\ 5)(3\ 6)\text{,}\) then \(f(1)=f(4)\text{,}\) \(f(2)=f(5)\text{,}\) and \(f(3)=f(6)\text{,}\) so \(f\) is determined by the three values \(f(1)\text{,}\) \(f(2)\text{,}\) and \(f(3)\text{.}\) The picture enumerator for these functions is, by <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" knowl-id="xref-PictureEnumeratorforFunctions" alt="Problem 313 " title="Problem 313 ">Problem 313</a> applied to colorings of the cycles, \((R^2+B^2)^3\text{.}\)'' In factored form, these enumerators are \(R^6+B^6\text{,}\) \((R+B)^6\text{,}\) \((R^3+B^3)^2\text{,}\) and \(R^2+B^2)^3\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
