<p>Given a walk between two vertices in a connected component, all edges of the walk must connect two vertices in the connected component, because if there were an edge in the walk that did not do so, it would violate the second part of the definition of a connected component.  Since, for each pair of vertices in the connected component there is a walk between them, there is such a walk in our connected component graph.</p>
