<p>Many of the problems we solved in <a href="what-is.html" class="xref" alt="Chapter 1 What is Combinatorics?" title="Chapter 1 What is Combinatorics?">Chapter 1</a> may be thought of as problems of distributing objects (such as pieces of fruit or ping-pong balls) to recipients (such as children). Some of the ways of viewing counting problems as distribution problems are somewhat indirect. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/ping-pong.html" knowl-id="xref-ping-pong" alt="Problem 37 " title="Problem 37 ">Problem 37</a> you probably noticed that the number of ways to pass out \(k\) ping-pong balls to \(n\) children so that no child gets more than one is the number of ways that we may choose a \(k\)-element subset of an \(n\)-element set. We think of the children as recipients and objects we are distributing as the identical ping-pong balls, distributed so that each recipient gets at most one ball. Those children who receive an object are in our set. It is helpful to have more than one way to think of solutions to problems. In the case of distribution problems, another popular model for distributions is to think of putting balls in boxes rather than distributing objects to recipients. Passing out identical objects is modeled by putting identical balls into boxes. Passing out distinct objects is modeled by putting distinct balls into boxes.</p>
