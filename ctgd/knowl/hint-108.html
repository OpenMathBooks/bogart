<p>Note that \(\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\text{.}\) So we have to figure out how choosing either \(k\) elements or \(n - 1\) elements out of \(n + k - 1\) elements constitutes the choice of a multiset. We really have no idea what set of \(n + k - 1\) objects to use, so why not use \([n + k - 1]\text{?}\) If we choose \(n - 1\) of these objects, there are \(k\) left over, the same number as the number of elements of our multiset. Since our multiset is supposed to be chosen from an \(n\)-element set, perhaps we should let the \(n\)-element set be \([n]\text{.}\) From our choice of \(n - 1\) numbers, we have to decide on the multiplicity of 1 through \(n\text{.}\) For example with \(n = 4\) and \(k = 6\text{,}\) we have \(n+k-1=9\text{.}\) Here, shown with underlines, is a selection of \(3=n-1\) elements from \([9]\text{:}\) \(1, 2, \underline{3}, 4 \underline{5}, 6, 7, \underline{8}, 9\text{.}\) How do the underlined elements give us a multiset of size 6 chosen from an [4]-element set? In this case, 1 has multiplicity 2, 2 has multiplicity 1, 3 has multiplicity 2, and 4 has multiplicity 1.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s3-1-distrib-idea.html#hint-108">in-context</a></span>
