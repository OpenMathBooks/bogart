<p>The telephone company in a city has \(n\) subscribers. Assume a telephone call involves exactly two subscribers (that is, there are no calls to outside the network and no conference calls), and that the configuration of the telephone network is determined by which pairs of subscribers are talking. Notice that we may think of a configuration of the telephone network as a permutation whose cycle decomposition consists entirely of one-cycles and two-cycles, that is, we may think of a configuration as an involution in the symmetric group \(S_n\text{.}\)</p>
