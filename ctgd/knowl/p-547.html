<p>A <b class="terminology">solution</b> to a recurrence relation is a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation. Thus a solution to <a knowl="./knowl/subsetequation.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetequation" alt="Equation 2.1 " title="Equation 2.1 ">Recurrence (2.1)</a> is \(s_n =2^n\text{.}\) Note that \(s_n=17\cdot2^n\) and \(s_n=-13\cdot2^n\) are also solutions to <a knowl="./knowl/subsetequation.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetequation" alt="Equation 2.1 " title="Equation 2.1 ">Recurrence (2.1)</a>. What this shows is that a recurrence can have infinitely many solutions. In a given problem, there is generally one solution that is of interest to us. For example, if we are interested in the number of subsets of a set, then the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/subsetequation.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetequation" alt="Equation 2.1 " title="Equation 2.1 ">Recurrence (2.1)</a> that we care about is \(s_n=2^n\text{.}\) Notice this is the only solution we have mentioned that satisfies \(s_0=1\text{.}\)</p>
