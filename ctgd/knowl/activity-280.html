<div class="introduction"><p>In <a knowl="./knowl/cube1.html" title="Figure 6.1.3">Figure 6.1.3</a> we show a cube with the positions of its vertices and faces labeled. As with motions of the square, we let we let \(\varphi(x)\) be the label of the place where vertex previously in position \(x\) is now.</p></div>

<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/cube1-prob.html" title="Problem 263">Problem 263</a> we wrote in two row notation the permutation \(\rho\) of the vertices that corresponds to rotating the cube 90 degrees around a vertical axis through the faces \(t\) (for top) and \(u\) (for underneath). (We rotated in a right-handed fashion around this axis, meaning that vertex 6 goes to the back and vertex 8 comes to the front.) Write in two row notation the permutation \(\overline{\rho}\) of the faces that corresponds to this member \(\rho\) of \(R\text{.}\) </p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/cube1-prob.html" title="Problem 263">Problem 263</a> we wrote in two row notation the permutation \(\varphi\) that rotates the cube 120 degrees around the diagonal from vertex 1 to vertex 7 and carries vertex 8 to vertex 6.  Write in two row notation the \(\overline{\varphi}\) of the faces that corresponds to this member of \(R\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/cube1-prob.html" title="Problem 263">Problem 263</a> we computed the two row notation for \(\rho\circ\varphi\text{.}\) Now compute the two row notation for \(\overline{\rho}\circ\overline{\varphi}\) (\(\overline{\rho}\) was defined in <a knowl="./knowl/actsonparta.html" title="Part 280.a">Part 280.a</a>), and write in two row notation the permutation \(\overline{\rho\circ\varphi}\) of the faces that corresponds to the action of the permutation \(\rho\circ\varphi\) on the faces of the cube. (For this question it helps to think geometrically about what motion of the cube is carried out by \(\rho\circ\varphi\text{.}\))  What do you observe about \(\overline{\rho\circ\varphi}\) and \(\overline{\rho}\circ\overline{\varphi}\text{?}\)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_groups-groupsact.html#activity-280">in-context</a></span>
