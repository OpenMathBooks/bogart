<p>We know that we can make 20 cents with four five-cent stamps. Now we let \(k\) be a number greater than 20, and assume that it is possible to make any amount between 20 and \(k-1\) cents in postage with five and six cent stamps. Now if \(k\) is less than 25, it is 21, 22, 23, or 24. We can make 21 with three fives and one six. We can make 22 with two fives and two sixes, 23 with one five and three sixes, and 24 with four sixes. Otherwise \(k-5\) is between 20 and \(k-1\) (inclusive) and so by our inductive hypothesis, we know that \(k-5\) cents can be made with five and six cent stamps, so with one more five cent stamp, so can \(k\) cents. Thus by the (strong) principle of mathematical induction, we can make \(n\) cents in stamps with five and six cent stamps for each \(n\ge 20\text{.}\)</p>
