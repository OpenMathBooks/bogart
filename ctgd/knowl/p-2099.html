<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/paintinglightpoles.html" knowl-id="xref-paintinglightpoles" alt="Problem 373 " title="Problem 373 ">ProblemÂ 373</a> what would the exponential generating function have been if we had asked for the number of ways to paint the poles with just one color of paint? With two colors of paint? What is the relationship between the EGF for painting the \(n\) poles with one color of paint and the EGF for painting the \(n\) poles with four colors of paint? What is the relationship between the EGF for painting the \(n\) poles with two colors of paint and the EGF for painting the poles with four colors of paint?</p>
