<p>Note that \(\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\text{.}\) We will show a bijection between ways of choosing \(n-1\) things our of \(n+k-1\) things and multisets. Namely, take \(n+k-1\) objects and line them up in a row. Choose \(n-1\) of them. Now let the multiplicity of element 1 of our multiset be the number of objects before the first thing we chose.  if \(1\lt i\lt n\text{,}\) let the multiplicity of element \(i\) of our multiset be the number of things between the \(i-1\)th thing we chose and the \(i\)th thing we choose. Let the multiplicity of the \(n\)th element of our multiset be the number of objects after the last one we chose. Another way to say the essentially same thing is to make a list of \(n+k-1\) blank spaces. We choose \(k\) of them in which we put ones and \(n-1\) of them in which we put plus signs. Then the multiplicity of element 1 is the number of ones before the first plus sign, the multiplicity of element \(n\) is the number of ones after the last plus sign and if \(1\lt i\lt n\text{,}\) the multiplicity of element \(i\) is the number of ones between the \((i-1)\)th plus sign and the \(i\)th plus sign.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s3-1-distrib-idea.html#solution-213">in-context</a></span>
