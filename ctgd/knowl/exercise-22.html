<p>The <b class="terminology">degree sequence</b> of a tree is a list of the degrees of the vertices in nonincreasing order.  For example the degree sequence of the first graph in <a knowl="./knowl/spanningtrees.html" knowl-id="xref-spanningtrees" alt="Figure 2.3.3 " title="Figure 2.3.3 ">Figure 2.3.3</a> is \((4,3,2,2,1)\text{.}\)  For a graph with vertices labeled 1 through \(n\text{,}\) the <b class="terminology">ordered degree sequence</b> of the graph is the sequence \((d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n)\) in which \(d_i\) is the degree of vertex \(i\text{.}\) For example, the ordered degree sqeuence of the first graph in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-Threegraphs" alt="Figure 2.3.1 " title="Figure 2.3.1 ">Figure 2.3.1</a> is \((1,2,3,3,1,1,2,1)\text{.}\) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>How many labelled trees are there on \(n\) vertices with ordered degree sequence \(d_1,d_2,\ldots d_n\text{?}\) (This problem appears again in the next chapter since some ideas in that chapter make it more straightforward.)</li>
<li>How many labeled trees are there on \(n\) vertices with the degree sequence in which the degree \(d\) appears \(i_d\) times?</li>
