<body><span class="solution"><p>We know that</p>
\begin{equation}
(x+1)^n=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}x^{i}\tag{3.2}
\end{equation}
<p>from the binomial theorem. (In the way we stated the binomial theorem, instead of \(\binom{n}{i}x^i\) we would have gotten \(\binom{n}{i}x^{n-i}\text{.}\) There are two ways to fix this. One is to observe that the coefficient of \(x^i\) in that expansion is \(\binom{n}{n-i}\text{,}\) which equals \(\binom{n}{i}\text{.}\) The other is to observe that when we expand \((1+x)^n\) according to the binomial theorem we get exactly what we wrote on the right hand side in <a knowl="./knowl/usingbinomialtheorem.html" knowl-id="xref-usingbinomialtheorem" alt="Equation 3.2 " title="Equation 3.2 ">EquationÂ (3.2)</a>.) Therefore every power of \(x+1\) is expressible in terms of powers of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
<p>How do we express powers of \(x\) in terms of powers of \(x+1\text{?}\) Some experimentation would help us guess how to do so; however there is a really nice trick that also isn't hard to see. Namely, we can write</p>
\begin{align*}
x^n =(x+1-1)^n= [(x+1) -1]^n =\amp  \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}(x+1)^{n-i}(-1)^i\\
=\amp
\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}(x+1)^i(-1)^{n-i}
\end{align*}
<p>This means that every power of \(x\) is expressible in terms of powers of \(x+1\) and the change of basis coefficients to express powers of \(x\) in terms of powers of \(x+1\) are \((-1)^{n-i}\binom{n}{i}\) while the change of basis coefficients used to express powers of \(x+1\) in terms of powers of \(x\) are \(\binom{n}{i}\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
