<body><div class="solution"><p>From the sixth factor of the product on, there is no way to choose a \(q^i\) that has \(i\) nonzero and less than six from the factor, so when we compute the coefficient of \(q^5\text{,}\) we can only choose the 1 from each of these terms. In the first five factors, we choose any combination of powers that adds to 5. We can choose \(q^5\) from the fifth and 1 from the rest, q from the first, \(q^4\) from the second and 1 from the rest, \(q^2\) from the second, \(q^3\) from the third and 1 from the rest, \(q^2\) from the first and \(q^3\) from the third and 1 from the rest, \(q^3\) from the first, \(q^2\) from the second, and 1 from the rest \(q^5\) from the first and 1 from the rest, and these are the only ways to get a \(q^5\) in the product. Thus the coefficient of \(q^5\) is 7.</p></div></body>
