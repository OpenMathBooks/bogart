<p>The caveat in the second note seemed to be the largest toward fulfilling the goal of the third, as the “official” version of the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> had a different chapter structure than the <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> source files provided. This was mostly the result of splitting a chapter into two and rearranging a few topics, but there were also places where problems were split or merged between the source version and the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> version. The <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> version also came with copious hints that readers could access online, but no <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> source existed for these hints.</p>
