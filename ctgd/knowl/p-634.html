<p>We are now going to introduce a method to prove the formula you guessed. Given a tree with two or more vertices, labeled with positive integers, we define a sequence \(b_1,b_2,\ldots\) of integers inductively as follows: If the tree has two vertices, the sequence consists of one entry, namely the label of the vertex with the larger label. Otherwise, let \(a_1\) be the lowest numbered vertex of degree 1 in the tree. Let \(b_1\) be the label of the unique vertex in the tree adjacent to \(a_1\) and write down \(b_1\text{.}\) For example, in the first graph in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" title="Figure 2.3.1">Figure 2.3.1</a>, \(a_1\) is 1 and \(b_1\) is 2. Given \(a_1\) through \(a_{i-1}\text{,}\) let \(a_i\) be the lowest numbered vertex of degree 1 in the tree you get by deleting \(a_1\) through \(a_{i-1}\)and let \(b_i\) be the unique vertex in this new tree adjacent to \(a_i\text{.}\) For example, in the first graph in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" title="Figure 2.3.1">Figure 2.3.1</a>, \(a_2=2\) and \(b_2=3\text{.}\) Then \(a_3=5\) and \(b_3=4\text{.}\) We use \(b\) to stand for the sequence of \(b_i\)s we get in this way. In the tree (the first graph) in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" title="Figure 2.3.1">Figure 2.3.1</a>, the sequence \(b\) is 2344378. (If you are unfamiliar with inductive (recursive) definition, you might want to write down some other labeled trees on eight vertices and construct the sequence of \(b_i\)s.)</p>
