</h6>There is a fascinating subtle issue of what makes two molecules different.  For example, suppose we have a molecule in the form of a cube, with one atom at each vertex.  If we interchange the top and bottom faces of the cube, each atom is still connected to exactly the same atoms as before.   However we cannot achieve this permutation of the vertices by a member of the rotation group of the cube.  It could well be that the two versions of the molecule interact with other molecules in different ways, in which case we would consider them chemically different.  On the other hand if the two versions interact with other molecules in the same way, we would have no reason to consider them chemically different.  This kind of symmetry is an example of what is called <dfn class="terminology">chirality</dfn> in chemistry.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_groups-polya.html#fn-24">in-context</a></span>
