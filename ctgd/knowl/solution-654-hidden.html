<body><div class="solution"><p>We let the family \(\F\) be the set of permutations of subsets of the positive integers whose cycle decomposition is either a one-cycle or one two-cycle. Then \(\F\) is a psecies of structures on the finite subsets of the positive integers. We saw in <a knowl="./knowl/exp_oneortwo-cycle_.html" title="Problem 410">Problem 410</a> that the EGF for \(\F\) is \(x+x^2/2\text{.}\) By the <a knowl="./knowl/exponentialformulathm.html" title="Theorem C.5.1">exponential formula</a>, the EGF for sets of disjoint one and two-cycles is \(e^x+x^2/2\text{.}\) But there is a bijection between the sets of disjoint one and two-cycles and permutations that are a product of disjoint one and two-cycles. This confirms the result of <a knowl="./knowl/telephonenetworkEGF.html" title="Problem 387">Problem 387</a>.</p></div></body>
