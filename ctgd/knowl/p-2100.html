<p>There seem to be two essential features that relate to the product of exponential generating functions. First, we are considering <em class="terminology">structures</em> that consist of a set and some additional mathematical construction on or relationship among the elements of that set. For example, our set might be a set of light poles and the additional construction might be a coloring function defined on that set. Other examples of additional mathematical constructions or relationships on a set could include a permutation of that set; in particular an involution or a derangement, a partition of that set, a graph on that set, a connected graph on that set, an arrangement of the elements of that set around a circle, or an arrangement of the elements of that set on the shelves of a bookcase. In fact a set with no additional construction or arrangement on it is also an example of a structure. Its additional construction is the empty set!  When a structure consists of the set \(S\) plus the additional construction, we say the structure <!--Style me with CSS--><em>uses</em> \(S\text{.}\) What all the examples we have mentioned in our earlier discussion of exponential generating functions have in common is that the number of structures that use a given set is determined by the size of that set. We will call a family \(\F\) of structures a <em class="terminology">species</em> of structures on subsets of a set \(X\) if structures are defined on finite subsets of \(X\) and if the number of structures in the family using a finite set \(S\) is finite and is determined by the size of \(S\) (that is, if there is a bijection between subsets \(S\) and \(T\) of \(X\text{,}\) the number of structures in the family that use \(S\) equals the number of structures in the family that use \(T\)). We say a structure is an <em class="terminology">\(\F\)-structure</em> if it is a member of the family \(\F\text{.}\)</p>
