<p>Because the number of ways to break a given set of \(2n\) people into two-cycles depends only on \(n\) and not the particular set of \(2n\) people we choose. The number of ways to break up a set of size \(k\) into one-cycles is one, so it doesn't depend on which set of size \(k\) we are breaking up. (In fact it doesn't depend on \(k\) either, but that is irrelevant here.) Of course since these people are doing nothing, the structure of one-cycles is just another way to say that our species consists of sets with no additional structure.</p>
