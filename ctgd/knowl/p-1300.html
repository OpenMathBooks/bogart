<p>Let \(d_n\) be the number of ways to divide an \(n\)-gon into triangles by means of nonintersecting diagonals. Take an \(n\)-gon and label its vertices cyclically from 1 to \(n\text{.}\) Any triangulation must have a triangle containing the edge \(1n\) between vertex 1 and vertex \(n\text{.}\) The third vertex can be any number between 2 and \(n-1\text{.}\) We consider two cases. First, if the third vertex is 2 or \(n-1\text{,}\) then we have divided our polygon up into a triangle and an \((n-1)\)-gon, and any triangulation of that \((n-1)\)-gon joins with our original triangle to give us a triangulation of the \(n\)-gon. Second, if the third vertex of our original triangle is vertex \(i\) with \(3\le i\le n-2\) then we have divided our polygon into the polygon with the \(i\) edges \(12\text{,}\) \(23\text{,}\) …, \((i-1)i\text{,}\) \(i1\text{,}\) the polygon with \(n-i+1\) edges \(ni\text{,}\) \(i(i+1)\text{,}\) …, \((n-1)n\text{,}\) and the original triangle with edges \(n1\text{,}\) \(1i\text{,}\) \(in\text{.}\) Triangulations of the first two of these polygons join with the original triangle to give us a triangulation of the original polygon.</p>
