<p>We use inclusion and exclusion, with \(A\) being the set of all circular arrangements of the children (where rotation of an arrangement gives the same arrangement, but flipping gives a different arrangement). The set \(A_i\) is the set of arrangements such that child \(i\) has the same child to the immediate right both times they join hands. Given a set \(S\subseteq [n]\text{,}\) we can think of arranging units consisting of individual children and strings of children holding hands in a circle. We have \(n-s\) of these units because \(s\) children are to the immediate right of someone in units of size more than one (and everyone else is leftmost in a unit or not in a string of length 2 or more). Each string of children can be arranged in only one way, because our set specifies who has to have the same child on the right. Thus \(\left|\bigcap_{i\colon i\in S} A_i\right| = (n-s-1)!\text{.}\) This gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\left|\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}\right| &amp;=\sum_{S:S\subseteq [n]}
(-1)^{|S|}(n-|S|-1)!\\
&amp;=
\sum_{s=0}^n (-1)^s \binom{n}{s} (n-s-1)!\\
&amp;= \sum_{s=0}^n (-1)^s \frac{n!}{s!(n-s)}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>ways for the children to join hands the second time so that none of them has the same child to the right.</p>
