<p>Notice that the first question in <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminpints.html" title="Problem 8">Problem 8</a> asked you for the number of ways to choose a three element subset from a 12 element subset. You may have seen a notation like \(\binom{n}{k}\text{,}\) \(C(n,k)\text{,}\) or \(_nC_k\) which stands for the number of ways to choose a \(k\)-element subset from an \(n\)-element set. The number \(\binom{n}{k}\) is read as “\(n\) choose \(k\)” and is called a <dfn class="terminology">binomial coefficient</dfn> for reasons we will see later on. Another frequently used way to read the binomial coefficient notation is ``the number of combinations  of \(n\) things taken \(k\) at a time." You are going to be asked to construct two bijections that relate to these numbers and figure out what famous formula they prove. We are going to think about subsets of the \(n\)-element set \([n] =
\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\text{.}\) As an example, the set of two-element subsets of \([4]\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\{\{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{1,4\}, \{2,3\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,4\}\}.
\end{equation*}
