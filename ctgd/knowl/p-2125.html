<p>We noted in the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/derangementsand1cycles.html" knowl-id="xref-derangementsand1cycles" alt="Problem 391 " title="Problem 391 ">ProblemÂ 391</a> that every permutation is the product of a derangement (on the elements that are not fixed by the permutation) and a product of one cycles (on the elements that are fixed by the permutation). Thus we can think of every permutation as an ordered pair consisting of a derangement and a product of one-cycles, and the product principle tells us that the EGF for all permutations is the product of the EGF for derangements and the EGF for identity permutations.</p>
