<p>Above row zero, we have some freedom. The \(-1,-1\) and the \(-1,0 \)entry must add to one, so they can be \(-x\) and \(x+1\) for any number \(x\text{.}\) To the right of the \(-1,0\) entry they must alternate between \((-x-1)\) and \(x+1\) while to the left of the \(-1,1\) entry they must alternate between \(-x\) and \(x\text{,}\) ending with the \(-x\) in position \(-1,1\text{.}\) Now if we know the entry in row \(-2\) and column 0, we can use the Pascal equation (in the form \(\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n}{k} - \binom{n-1}{k}\)) to compute all the entries to the left of it, and (in a different form) to compute all the entries to the right of it. Thus we may be arbitrary about the entries in column 0 (or, in fact, one entry in each row) and then the Pascal Equation tells us how to fill in the rest of each row. We shall see later on that there is one very natural choice for how to fill in all the rows above row zero.</p>
