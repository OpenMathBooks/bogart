<p>To be precise, we define \(x^{\underline{j}}\) to be \(x(x-1)\cdots (x-j+1)\text{.}\) At first glance it looks like we could express \(x^{\underline{j}}\) in terms of powers of \(x\) by simply substituting \(x\) for \(n\) in the equation \(\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k\text{.}\) However this gives us \(\sum_{j=0}^x x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = x^k\text{,}\) and we have never defined what we mean by a sum whose upper limit is a variable \(x\text{.}\) Thus we need to examine the equation \(\sum_{j=0}^n
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k\) to see if we can replace the \(n\) that is the upper limit of the sum with something else. Notice that \(S(k,j)=0\) when \(j&gt;k\text{.}\) This means that if \(k\le j\text{,}\) then \(\sum_{j=0}^n
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\text{.}\) Notice also that \(n^{\underline{j}}= n(n-1)\cdots(n-j+1)\) is zero when \(j&gt;n\) because one of its factors is zero then. This implies that if \(k&gt;j\text{,}\) then \(\sum_{j=0}^n
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\text{.}\) Therefore, regardless of the relative size of \(k\) and \(n\text{,}\) we have that \(\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\text{.}\) Therefore</p>
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=n^k. \tag{3.1}
\end{equation}
<p>It makes sense to write the polynomial \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\text{;}\) this is simply a polynomial of degree \(k\) in the variable \(x\text{.}\) The expression \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) is also a polynomial in \(x\text{,}\) but it might not be of degree \(k\) since we are subtracting a degree \(k\) term from a degree \(k\) polynomial. In fact for every positive integer value \(n\) of \(x\text{,}\) this polynomial is zero. That is, \(\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-n^k=0\text{,}\) which is just a restatement of  <a knowl="./knowl/changeupperlimit.html" knowl-id="xref-changeupperlimit" alt="Equation 3.1 " title="Equation 3.1 ">EquationÂ (3.1)</a>. But it is a fact of algebra that the number of solutions of a nontrivial polynomial equation is no more than the degree of the polynomial. Since the polynomial equation \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) has infinitely many different solutions, it must be a trivial equation; that is \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) must be zero for every real (and even every complex) number \(x\text{.}\) Thus \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=x^k\text{,}\) and we have expressed \(x^k\) in terms of \(x^{\underline{j}}\) for \(j\le k\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s3-2-partitions.html#solution-242">in-context</a></span>
