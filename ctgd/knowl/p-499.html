<p>Perhaps the first thing one needs to ask is why proving that if there are \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\)people in a room, then there are either at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n\) mutual strangers proves that \(R(m, n)\) exists. Can you see why this tells us that there is some number \(R\) of people such that if \(R\) people are in a room, then there are \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers? And why does that mean the Ramsey Number exists?</p>
