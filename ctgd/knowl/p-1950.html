<p>Suppose that \(R\) is an equivalence relation on a set \(X\) and for each \(x\in X\text{,}\) let \(C_x = \{y| y\in X \text{ and }
yRx\}\text{.}\) If \(C_x\) and \(C_z\) have an element \(y\) in common, what can you conclude about \(C_x\) and \(C_z\) (besides the fact that they have an element in common!)? Be explicit about what property(ies) of equivalence relations justify your answer. Why is every element of \(X\) in some set \(C_x\text{?}\) Be explicit about what property(ies) of equivalence relations you are using to answer this question. Notice that we might simultaneously denote a set by \(C_x\) and \(C_y\text{.}\) Explain why the union of the sets \(C_x\) is \(X\text{.}\) Explain why two distinct sets \(C_x\) and \(C_z\) are disjoint. What do these sets have to do with the “clumping” you saw in the digraph of <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problem 344</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">Problem 345</a>?</p>
