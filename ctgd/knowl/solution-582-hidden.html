<body><div class="solution"><p>If \(C_x\) and \(C_y\) have the element \(z\) in common, then by symmetry and transitivity, all elements in \(C_x\) are related to \(z\) and by symmetry and transitivity, all elements in \(C_y\) are related to \(z\text{.}\) Then by symmetry and transitivity again, all elements of \(C_y\) are related to \(x\text{,}\) so \(C_y\subseteq C_x\text{.}\) By the same kind of reasoning, \(C_x\subseteq C_y\text{.}\) Therefore, \(C_x=C_y\text{.}\) Every element \(x\) is in the set \(C_x\) by reflexivity Thus the union of the sets \(C_x\) is \(X\text{.}\) The sets \(C_x\) and \(C_y\) are disjoint if they are different, because if they have a common element \(z\) then they are equal. By definition, the sets \(C_x\) form a partition of \(X\text{.}\) The clumps that we saw in those problems are the blocks of the partition.</p></div></body>
