<body><div class="solution"><p>There are eight places where vertex one can go. Once vertex 1 is placed, there are three ways the three faces including vertex 1 can be placed so that the cube returns to its original location, and then the location of all the vertices is determined. Thus there are 24 elements of the group. Of them, we have the identity, three rotations about each of the three axes through the midpoints of the faces, one additional rotation about each of the six axes joining opposite faces, and \(2\cdot 4 = 8\) additional rotations about each of the four axes joining a vertex to the diagonally (in three dimensions) opposite vertex. This gives us a total of \(10+6+8=24\) rotations, so every element of the group is a rotation.</p></div></body>
