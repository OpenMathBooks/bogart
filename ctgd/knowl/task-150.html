<p>The largest part of a partition counted by \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\) is either \(m\) or is less than or equal to \(m-1\text{.}\)  In the second case, the partition fits into a rectangle that is at most \(m-1\) units wide and at most \(n\) units deep.  What is the generating function for partitions of this type?  In the first case, what kind of rectangle does the partition we get by removing the largest part sit in?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle after we remove a largest part of size \(m\text{?}\)  What recurrence relation does this give you?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>
<p>What recurrence do you get from the other operation we studied in <a knowl="./knowl/numberpartitionrecurrence.html" knowl-id="xref-numberpartitionrecurrence" alt="Problem 171 " title="Problem 171 ">Problem 171</a>?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iii)</span></h6>
<p>It is quite likely that the two recurrences you got are different.  One would expect that they might give different values for \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\text{.}\)  Can you resolve this potential conflict?</p>
