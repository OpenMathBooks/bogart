<body><span class="solution"><p>We prove by induction that if \(S\) is a set of functions defined on \([m]\) such that </p>

</ul>
<p> then there are \(\prod_{i=1}^m k_i\) functions in \(S\text{.}\) When \(m=1\text{,}\) the product is \(k_1\) and there are \(k_1\) functions in \(S\text{.}\) Now assume inductively that when \(S'\) is a set of functions defined on \([m-1]\) such that </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>There are \(k_1\) choices for \(f(1)\) and</li>
<li>when \(2\le i\le m-1\text{,}\) for each choice of \(f(1)\text{,}\) \(f(2)\text{,}\) … \(f(i-1)\text{,}\) there are \(k_i\) choices for \(f(i)\text{,}\)</li>
</ul>
<p> then there are \(\prod_{i=1}^{m-1} k_i\) functions in \(S'\text{.}\) Now partition \(S\) into \(k_1\) sets \(S_j\text{,}\) where \(S_j\) is the set of functions \(f\) in \(S\) with \(f(n) = y_j\) for each of the \(k_n\) values \(y_j\) that are possible for \(f(1)\text{.}\) Thus \(S\) is a union of \(k_n\) sets \(S_j\) each of size \(\prod_{i=1}^{m-1} k_i\) (by the inductive hypothesis), and so by the product principle for unions of sets, \(S\) has size \(\prod_{i=1}^{m} k_i\text{.}\) Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, we have proved the general product principle.</p></span></body>
