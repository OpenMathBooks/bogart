<p>Suppose that \(a_i\) is the number of ways to paint a set of \(i\) poles with red and white, and \(b_j\) is the number of ways to paint a set of \(j\) poles with blue, green, and yellow. In how many ways may we take a set \(N\) of \(n\) poles, divide it up into two sets \(I\) and \(J\) (using \(i\) to stand for the size of \(I\) and \(j\) to stand for the size of the set \(J\text{,}\) and allowing \(i\) and \(j\) to vary) and paint the poles in \(I\) red and white and the poles in \(J\) blue, green, and yellow? (Give your answer in terms of \(a_i\) and \(b_j\text{.}\)  Don't figure out formulas for  \(a_i\) and \(b_j\) to use in your answer; that will make it harder to get the point of the problem!)
