<body><div class="solution"><p>This may look difficult because one can't decide in advance on whether to try to induct on \(m\text{,}\) on \(n\text{,}\) or on their sum. In some sense, it doesn't matter which you choose to induct on, though inducting on the sum would look more complicated. For most people inducting on \(n\) fits their way of working with exponents best.</p></div></body>
