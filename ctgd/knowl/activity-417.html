<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/paintinglightpoles.html" title="Problem 373">ProblemÂ 373</a> we saw that the generating function for the number of ways to use five colors of paint to paint \(n\) light poles along the north side of Main Street in Anytown was \(e^{4x}\text{.}\) We should expect an explanation of this EGF using the exponential formula. Let \(\F\) be the family of all one-element sets of light poles with the additional construction of an ordered pair consisting of a light pole and a color. Thus a given light pole occurs in five ordered pairs. Put no structures on any other finite set. Show that this is a species of structures on the finite subsets of the positive integers. What is the exponential generating function \(f(x)\) for \(\F\text{?}\) Assuming that there is no upper limit on the number of light poles, what subsets of \(S\) does the exponential formula tell us are counted by the coefficient of \(x^n\) in \(e^{f(x)}\text{?}\) How do the sets being counted relate to ways to paint light poles?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="app3-5-expformula.html#activity-417">in-context</a></span>
