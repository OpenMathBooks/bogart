<p>The sequence \(a_1a_2\ldots
a_k\) corresponds to the set of \(i\) such that \(a_i = 1\text{.}\) This is a bijection because each sequence gives a set, and each set can be the set of places where a sequence is 1. Since there are \(2^n\) integers which are between 0 and \(2^n-1\text{,}\) and they correspond to sequences of length \(n\) (notice, we have another bijection, the one between a number and its binary representation), there are \(2^n\) subsets of the \(n\)-element set \([n]\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-2-basics.html#solution-40">in-context</a></span>
