<body><div class="solution"><p>We have said for each element of our set that it is related to itself, so the relation is reflexive. If \(x\) and \(y\) are in a given one of those sets, then \(y\) and \(x\) are in that same given set. If \(x\) and \(y\) are in the same set, and if \(y\) and \(z\) are in the same set, then \(x\) and \(z\) must be in the same set because there is one and only one set that \(y\) is in. Thus the relation is an equivalence relation.</p></div></body>
