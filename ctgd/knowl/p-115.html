<p>If we have a function \(f\) from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\text{,}\) we draw a line of dots or circles, called <em class="terminology">vertices</em> to represent the elements of \(S\) and another (usually parallel) line of circles or dots to represent the elements of \(T\text{.}\) We then draw an arrow from the circle for \(x\) to the circle for \(y\) if \(f(x) = y\text{.}\) Sometimes, as in part (e) of the figure, if we have a function from a set \(S\) to itself, we draw only one set of vertices representing the elements of \(S\text{,}\) in which case we can have arrows both entering and leaving a given vertex. As you see, the digraph can be more enlightening in this case if we experiment with the function to find a nice placement of the vertices rather than putting them in a row.</p>
