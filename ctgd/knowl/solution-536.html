<p>The computer placements are colorings of the vertices of the graph by the set of three kinds of computers, say \(\{A,B,C\}\text{.}\) Thus we are asking for the number of orbits of the automorphism group of the graph on colorings of the vertices with the colors \(\{A, B,
C\}\text{.}\) To find this number we need to compute the cycle index of the automorphism group. An automorphism will send vertices 1, 2, and 3 to three vertices that are mutually connected; i.e., a triangle. Further, each of vertices 4, 5, and 6 is adjacent to exactly two of vertices of 1, 2, and 3. In fact, for any of the eight triangles in the graph, each vertex not in the triangle is adjacent to exactly two vertices of the triangle (and a different two for each vertex). Therefore we can send the vertices 1, 2, and 3, to any of the eight triangles in any of six orders, and this completely determines an automorphism. Thus there are \(6\cdot8=48\) elements in the group of automorphisms. The dihedral group \(D_6\) is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms. the permutations with four one-cycles and the two-cycle \((1\ 4)\text{,}\) \((2\ 5)\text{,}\) or \((3\ 6)\) are also in the group of automorphisms. (For example, 1 is adjacent to everything but 4, and 4 is adjacent to everything but 1, so interchanging them leaves us with exactly the same edges.) We use the notation \((i\ j)\) not onlly to stand for a two-cycle, but also to stand for the permutation with four one-cycles and the two-cycle \((i,\ j)\text{.}\) We will write out the cycle decomposition of each element of \(D_6\text{,}\) and then do the same for the set \((1\ 4)D_6 = \{(1\ 4)\sigma\mid \sigma\in D_6\}\text{,}\) and from those we will be able to get the cycle index of the automorphism group acting on the vertices. The cycle decompositions of the elements of \(D_6\) are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cccc}
(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6)\amp (1\ 3\ 5)(2\ 4\ 6)\amp (1\ 4)(2\ 5)(3 \ 6)\amp  (1\ 5\ 3)(2\ 6\ 4)\\(1\ 6\ 5\ 4\
3\ 2)\amp (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\amp (1)(4)(2\ 6)(3\ 5)\amp (2)(5)(1\ 3)(4\ 6)\\
(3)(6)(1\ 5)(2\ 4)\amp (1\ 2)(3\ 6)(4\ 5)\amp (1\ 6)(2\ 5)(3\ 4)\amp (1\ 4)(2\ 3)(5\ 6)
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the cycle decompositions of the elements of \((1\ 4)D_6\) are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cccc}
(1\ 2\ 3) (4\ 5\ 6)\amp (1\ 3\ 5\ 4\ 6\ 2)\amp (1) (4)(2\ 5)(3 \ 6)\amp  (1\ 5\ 3\ 4\ 2\ 6)\\(1\ 6\
5)(2\ 4\ 3)\amp (1\ 4)(2)(3)(5)(6)\amp (1\ 4)(2\ 6)(3\ 5)\amp (2)(5)(1\ 3\ 4\ 6)\\
(3)(6)(1\ 5\ 4\ 2)\amp (1\ 2\ 4\ 5)(3\ 6)\amp (1\ 6\ 4\ 3)(2\ 5)\amp (1)(4)(2\ 3)(5\ 6).
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that neither \((2\ 5)\) nor \((3\ 6)\) is in either of our sets. From this, it is a straightforward series of steps to show that our group is the union</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
D_6\cup (1\ 4)D_6 \cup(2\ 5)D_6 \cup (3\ 6)D_6.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But by symmetry, the cycle decomposition of \((1\ 4)D_6\text{,}\) \((2\ 5)D_6\) and \((3\ 6)D_6\) will be the same, so the cycle index for our group is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{48} \left(Z^6_1 + 8Z^2_3
+8z_6^1 +7z_2^3+9z_1^2z_2^2 +3z_1^4z_2+
6z_2z_4+6z_1^2z_4\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since we have three kinds of computers, we substitute 3 for each variable to get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{48} \left(3^6 + 8\cdot3^2
+8\cdot3^1 +7\cdot3^3+9\cdot3^4 +3\cdot3^5+
6\cdot3^2+6\cdot3^3\right)=56\text{.}
