<p>For this problem we need the cycle index for the action of the symmetric group on five letters acting on two-element subsets of those five letters. Each way of partitioning the number five describes the cycle structure of an element of \(S_5\) acting on \([5]\text{.}\) The cycle structure of a permutation \(\sigma\) on the two-element subsets of \([5]\) will be determined by its cycle structure on \([5]\text{.}\) The partitions of five and the cycle structures they give on two-element subsets are: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>\((1,1,1,1,1) =1^5\) is the cycle structure of the identity; acting on two-element subsets the identity is a product of \(\binom{5}{2}=10\) one-cycles.  Of course there is only one identity permutation.</p></li>
<li><p>A permutation with cycle structure \(2^1 1^3\) will fix the two element set in the two cycle and each pair of the three elements outside for a total of four one-cycles; each pair of an element in the two cycle and an element not will be in a two cycle.  There are 6 such pairs and thus three two-cycles, so such a permutation has 3 two-cycles and four one-cycles.  There are \(\binom{5}{2}=10\) such permutations.</p></li>
<li><p>A permutation with cycle structure \(2^2 1^1\) will have a one-cycle of two-sets for each two cycle, any other two-set will be in a  two cycle.  There are \(4+2+2=8\) such two-sets and thus four two-cycles, so such a permutation has four two cycles and two one cycles.  There are \(\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2}/2 =15\) such permutations.</p></li>
<li><p>A permutation with cycle structure \(3^1 1^2\) will have one cycle of size 1 on two-sets from the two one-element cycles of the original action; each other two-element subset will be in a three cycle.  There are \(\binom{3}{2}+3\cdot2=9\) such pairs, and so there are three three-cycles of two-element subsets.  Thus such a permutation has one one-cycle and three three-cycles in its action of two-sets. There are \(2\binom{5}{3}=20\) such permutations.</p></li>
<li><p>A permutation with cycle structure \(3^1 2^1\) will have one one-cycle on two-sets from the two-cycle of the original action, it will have \(\binom{3}{2}\)  two-sets in three cycles,  and will have six two-sets in six-cycles, and so will have just one six-cycle of two-sets.  Thus such a permutation has one one-cycle, one three-cycle and one six-cycle when it acts on two-sets.  There are \(2\binom{5}{3}=20\) such permutations.</p></li>
<li><p>A permutation with cycle structure \(4^1 1^1\) has a four-cycle of two-subsets and one two-cycle of two-subsets from its own four-cycle and another four cycle of pairs of members of the four-cycle and one cycle. thus it has two four-cycles and two one-cycles There are \(6\binom{5}{4}=30\) such permutations.</p></li>
<li><p>A permutation with cycle structure \(5^1\) will have two five-cycles in its action on two-sets.  There are \(4!=24\) such permutations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> Thus for the group \(S_5\) acting on pairs from \([5]\text{,}\) the cycle index is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{120}\left(z_1^{10}+10z_2^3z_1^4+15z_2^4z_2+20z_3^3z_1+20z_6z_3z_1+
30z_4^2z_2+ 24z_5^2\right).
\end{equation*}
<p>Substituting 2 for each variable gives us that there are</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{120}\left(2^{10}+10\cdot2^7+15\cdot2^5+20\cdot2^4+20\cdot2^3+30\cdot2^3+
24\cdot2^2\right)=30
\end{equation*}
<p>graphs on five vertices.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_groups-polya.html#solution-536">in-context</a></span>
