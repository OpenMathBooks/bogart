<p>The problem is asking you to describe a one-to-one function from the set of binary representations of numbers between \(0\) and \(2^n-1\) onto the set of subsets of the set \([n]\text{.}\) Write down these two sets for \(n = 2\text{.}\) They should both have four elements. The set of binary representations should contain the string \(00\text{.}\) You could think of this as the instruction ``take no ones and take no twos.'' In that context, what could you think of the string \(11\) as standing for? This should help you describe a function. Of course now you have to figure out how to show it is one-to-one and onto.</p>
