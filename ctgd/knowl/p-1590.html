<p>We have seen that the fact that we have defined a permutation group as the permutations of some specific set doesn't preclude us from thinking of the elements of that group as permuting the elements of some other set as well. In order to keep track of which permutations of which set we are using to define our group and which other set is being permuted as well, we introduce some new language and notation. We are going to say that the group \(D_4\) “acts” on the edges and diagonals of a square and the group \(R\) of permutations of the vertices of a cube that arise from rigid motions of the cube “acts” on the edges, faces, diagonals, etc. of the cube.</p>
