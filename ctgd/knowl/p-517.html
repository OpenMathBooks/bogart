<p><a knowl="./knowl/Ramseybound2.html" knowl-id="xref-Ramseybound2" alt="Problem 83 " title="Problem 83 ">Problem 83</a> gives us an upper bound on \(R(n,n)\text{.}\) A very clever technique due to Paul Erdös, called the “probabilistic method,” will give a lower bound. Since both bounds are exponential in \(n\text{,}\) they show that \(R(n,n)\) grows exponentially as \(n\) gets large. An analysis of what happens to a function of \(n\) as \(n\) gets large is usually called an <b class="terminology">asymptotic analysis</b>. The <b class="terminology">probabilistic method</b>, at least in its simpler forms, can be expressed in terms of averages, so one does not need to know the language of probability in order to understand it. We will apply it to Ramsey numbers in the next problem. Combined with the result of <a knowl="./knowl/Ramseybound2.html" knowl-id="xref-Ramseybound2" alt="Problem 83 " title="Problem 83 ">Problem 83</a>, this problem will give us that \(\sqrt{2}^{ n}\lt R(n,n)\lt 2^{2n-2}\text{,}\) so that we know that the Ramsey number \(R(n,n)\) grows exponentially with \(n\text{.}\)</p>
