<p><a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample1.html" title="Part 360.a">Parts a</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample2.html" title="Part 360.b">b</a> suggest strongly that the number of subsets of a \(n\)-element set is \(2^n\text{.}\) In particular, the empty set has \(2^0\) subsets, a one-element set has \(2^1\) subsets, itself and the empty set, and in <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample1.html" title="Part 360.a">Parts a</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample2.html" title="Part 360.b">b</a> we saw that two-element and three-element sets have \(2^2\) and \(2^3\) subsets respectively. So there are certainly some values of \(n\) for which an \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets. One way to prove that an \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets for all values of \(n\) is to argue by contradiction. For this purpose, suppose there is a nonnegative integer \(n\) such that an \(n\)-element set doesn't have exactly \(2^n\) subsets. In that case there may be more than one such \(n\text{.}\) Choose \(k\) to be the smallest such \(n\text{.}\) Notice that \(k -1\) is still a positive integer, because \(k\) can't be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Since \(k\) was the smallest value of \(n\) we could choose to make the statement “An \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets” false, what do you know about the number of subsets of a \((k - 1)\)-element set? What do you know about the number of subsets of the \(k\)-element set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k \}\) that don't contain \(k\text{?}\) What do you know about the number of subsets of \(\{1,
2, \ldots,  k \}\) that do contain \(k\text{?}\) What does the sum principle tell you about the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k \}\text{?}\) Notice that this contradicts the way in which we chose \(k\text{,}\) and the only assumption that went into our choice of \(k\) was that ``there is a nonnegative integer \(n\) such that an \(n\)-element set doesn't have exactly \(2^n\) subsets." Since this assumption has led us to a contradiction, it must be false. What can you now conclude about the statement ``for every nonnegative integer \(n\text{,}\) an n-element set has exactly \(2^n\) subsets?"</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="app2-1-induction.html#task-258">in-context</a></span>
