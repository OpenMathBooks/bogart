<p>A typical way to define a <dfn class="terminology">function</dfn> \(f\) from a set \(S\text{,}\) called the <dfn class="terminology">domain</dfn> of the function,  to a set \(T\text{,}\) called the <dfn class="terminology">range</dfn>,  is that \(f\) is a relationship between \(S\) to \(T\) that relates one and only one member of \(T\) to each element of \(X\text{.}\) We use \(f(x)\) to stand for the element of \(T\) that is related to the element \(x\) of \(S\text{.}\) If we wanted to make our definition more precise, we could substitute the word “relation” for the word “relationship” and we would have a more precise definition. For our purposes, you can choose whichever definition you prefer. However, in any case, there is a relation associated with each function. As we said above, the relation of a function \(f:
S\rightarrow T\) (which is the standard shorthand for “\(f\) is a function from \(S\) to \(T\)” and is usually read as \(f\) <dfn class="terminology">maps</dfn> \(S\) to \(T\)) is the set of all ordered pairs \((x,f(x))\) such that \(x\) is in \(S\text{.}\)</p>
