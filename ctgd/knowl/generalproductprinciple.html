<p>Now suppose we are thinking about a set \(S\) of functions \(f\) from \([m]\) to some set \(X\text{.}\) (For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem 6</a> we were thinking of the set of functions from the three possible places for scoops in an ice-cream cone to \(12\) flavors of ice cream.) Suppose there are \(k_1\) choices for \(f(1)\text{.}\) (In <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem 6</a>, \(k_1\) was \(12\text{,}\) because there were \(12\) ways to choose the first scoop.) Suppose that for each choice of \(f(1)\) there are \(k_2\) choices for \(f(2)\text{.}\) (For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem 6</a> \(k_2\) was \(12\) if the second flavor could be the same as the first, but \(k_2\) was \(11\) if the flavors had to be different.) In general, suppose that for each choice of \(f(1)\text{,}\) \(f(2)\text{,}\) … \(f(i-1)\text{,}\) there are \(k_i\) choices for \(f(i)\text{.}\) (For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem 6</a>, if the flavors have to be different, then for each choice of \(f(1)\) and \(f(2)\text{,}\) there are \(10\) choices for \(f(3)\text{.}\))</p>
<p>What we have assumed so far about the functions in \(S\) may be summarized as </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>There are \(k_1\) choices for \(f(1)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>For each choice of \(f(1)\text{,}\) \(f(2)\text{,}\) …, \(f(i-1)\text{,}\) there are \(k_i\) choices for \(f(i)\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>How many functions are in the set \(S\text{?}\) Is there any practical difference between the result of this problem and the general product principle?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-2-basics.html#generalproductprinciple">in-context</a></span>
