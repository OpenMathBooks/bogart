<div class="introduction"><p>In <a knowl="./knowl/largestpartatmostm.html" title="Part 201.b">Problem 201.b</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/atmostmparts.html" title="Problem 202">Problem 202</a> you gave the generating functions for, respectively, the number of partitions of \(k\) into parts the largest of which is at most \(m\) and for the number of partitions of \(k\) into at most \(m\) parts. In this problem we will give the generating function for the number of partitions of \(k\) into at most \(n\) parts, the largest of which is at most \(m\text{.}\) That is we will analyze \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_kq^k\) where \(a_k\) is the number of partitions of \(k\) into at most \(n\) parts, the largest of which is at most \(m\text{.}\) Geometrically, it is the generating function for partitions whose Young diagram fits into an \(m\) by \(n\) rectangle, as in <a knowl="./knowl/rectanglecomplement.html" title="Problem 167">Problem 167</a>. This generating function has significant analogs to the binomial coefficient \(\binom{m+n}{n}\text{,}\) and so it is denoted by \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\text{.}\) It is called a <dfn class="terminology">\(q\)-binomial coefficient</dfn>.</p></div>

<p>So far the analogy to \(\binom{m+n}{n}\) is rather thin! If we had a recurrence like the Pascal recurrence, that would demonstrate a real analogy. Is \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}= \qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}+\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}\text{?}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h6>

<p>The largest part of a partition counted by \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\) is either \(m\) or is less than or equal to \(m-1\text{.}\)  In the second case, the partition fits into a rectangle that is at most \(m-1\) units wide and at most \(n\) units deep.  What is the generating function for partitions of this type?  In the first case, what kind of rectangle does the partition we get by removing the largest part sit in?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle after we remove a largest part of size \(m\text{?}\)  What recurrence relation does this give you?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>

<p>It is quite likely that the two recurrences you got are different.  One would expect that they might give different values for \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\text{.}\)  Can you resolve this potential conflict?</p>
