<p>You can also prove by induction that the chromatic polynomial of a tree is \(x(x-1)^{n-1}\text{.}\) This is clearly true if there is one vertex. Otherwise, choose a vertex of degree 1 in an \(n\)-vertex tree and remove it. You may inductively assume that the chromatic polynomial of the remaining tree is \(x(x-1)^{n-2}\text{.}\) Now there are \(x-1\) choices for the color of the vertex you removed since it has degree 1, and so the chromatic polynomial of the tree is \(x(x-1)^{n-1}\text{.}\) There is also an inductive argument in which you delete and contract an arbitrary edge.</p>
