<p>American coins are all marked with the year in which they were made. How many coins do you need to have in your hand to guarantee that on two (at least) of them, the date has the same last digit? (When we say “to guarantee that on two (at least) of them,…” we mean that you can find two with the same last digit. You might be able to find three with that last digit, or you might be able to find one pair with the last digit 1 and one pair with the last digit 9, or any combination of equal last digits, as long as there is at least one pair with the same last digit.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-3-apps.html#elevencoins">in-context</a></span>
