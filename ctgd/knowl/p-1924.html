<p>So far we've used relations primarily to talk about functions. There is another kind of relation, called an equivalence relation, that comes up in the counting problems with which we began. In <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminpints.html" title="Problem 8">Problem 8</a> with three distinct flavors, it was probably tempting to say there are 12 flavors for the first pint, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, so there are \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) ways to choose the pints of ice cream. However, once the pints have been chosen, bought, and put into a bag, there is no way to tell which is first, which is second and which is third. What we just counted is lists of three distinct flavors—one to one functions from the set \(\{1,2,3\}\) in to the set of ice cream flavors. Two of those lists become equivalent once the ice cream purchase is made if they list the same ice cream. In other words, two of those lists become equivalent (are related) if they list same subset of the set of ice cream flavors. To visualize this relation with a digraph, we would need one vertex for each of the \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) lists. Even with five flavors of ice cream, we would need one vertex for each of \(5\cdot4\cdot3=60\) lists. So for now we will work with the easier to draw question of choosing three pints of ice cream of different flavors from four flavors of ice cream.</p>
