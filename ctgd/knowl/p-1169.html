<p>However, one makes sense and one doesn't. Figure out which one makes sense and explain why it makes sense and the other one doesn't. If we want a product of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where each \(p_i(x)\) is a nonzero polynomial in \(x\) to make sense, describe a relatively simple assumption about the polynomials \(p_i(x)\) that will make the product make sense. If we assumed the terms \(p_i(x)\) were nonzero power series, is there a relatively simple assumption we could make about them in order to make the product make sense? (Describe such a condition or explain why you think there couldn't be one.)</p>
