<p>We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block \(B_i\) for each \(i\) between \(1\) and \(n\text{.}\)  For now, suppose the value of \(i\text{,}\) while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece \(F\) (for “front”) consists of all steps before the \(i\)th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece \(U\) (for “up”) consists of the \(i\)th upstep.  The piece \(B\) (for “back”) is the portion of the path that follows the \(i\)th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as \(FUB\text{.}\)  Show that the function that takes \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block \(B_i\) of the partition.  (Notice that \(BUF\) can go below the \(x\) axis.)</p>
