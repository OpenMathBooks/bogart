<p>The formula you found in <a knowl="./knowl/chromaticpoly.html" title="Part 242.c">ProblemÂ 242.c</a> is a formula that involves powers of \(c\text{,}\) and so it is a polynomial function of \(c\text{.}\) Thus it is called the <dfn class="terminology">chromatic polynomial</dfn> of the graph \(G\text{.}\) Since we like to think about polynomials as having a variable \(x\) and we like to think of \(c\) as standing for some constant, people often use \(x\) as the notation for the number of colors we are using to color \(G\text{.}\) Frequently people will use \(\chi_G(x)\) to stand for the number of way to color \(G\) with \(x\) colors, and call \(\chi_G(x)\) the <dfn class="terminology">chromatic polynomial</dfn> of \(G\text{.}\)</p>
