<p>Recall that a Dyck Path is a diagonal lattice path that never goes lower than its starting point and a Catalan Path of length \(2n\) is a Dyck path that goes from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\) The Catalan number \(C_n\) is the number of Catalan paths of length \(2n\text{.}\) We take \(C_0=1\text{.}\) A Catalan path could touch the \(x\)-axis several times before it reaches \((2n,0)\text{.}\) Its first touch can be any point \((2i,0)\) between \((2,0)\) and \((2n,0)\text{.}\) For the path to touch first at \((0,2i)\text{,}\) the path must start with an upstep and then proceed as a Dyck path from \((1,1)\) to \((2i-1,1)\text{.}\) From there it must take a downstep. But the number of Dyck paths from \((1,1)\) to \((2i-1,1)\) is the same as the number of Catalan paths from \((0,0)\) to \((2i-2,0)\text{.}\) The number of Catalan paths is the number whose first touch of the \(x\)-axis is at \(x=2\) plus the number whose first touch is at \(x=4\text{,}\)â€¦, through the number whose first touch is at \(2n\text{.}\) After the first touch at \(x=2i\text{,}\) the path then behaves as a Catalan path from \((2i,0)\) to \((2n,0)\text{.}\) The number of such paths is \(C_{n-i}\text{.}\) By the product principle, the number of Catalan paths whose first touch is at \(x=2i\) is \(C_{i-1}C_{n-i}\text{.}\) Then by the sum principle, the number of Catalan paths of length 1 or more is</p>
