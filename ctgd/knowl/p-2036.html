<p>Now assume that \(m \gt 1\) and that for any positive integer \(m' \lt m\text{,}\) there are unique nonnegative integers \(q'\) and \(r'\) such that \(m' = q'n+r'\text{,}\) with \(0 \le r' \lt n\text{.}\)  If \(m \lt n\text{,}\) then we can let \(q = 0\) and \(r = m\text{,}\) and we have our \(q\) and \(r\text{.}\)  If \(m = n\text{,}\) we may choose \(q = 1\) and \(r = 0\) and we have our \(q\) and \(r\) again.  Therefore we may assume that \(m \gt n\text{.}\) In this case, \(m-n\) is a positive integer, and so since \(m-n \lt n\text{,}\) we have that, for unique nonnegative integers \(q'\) and \(r'\text{,}\)</p>

<p>with \(0 \le r \lt n\text{.}\)  But then adding \(n\) to both sides of the equation gives us \(m = (q'+1)n + r'\text{,}\) with \(0 \le r' \lt n\text{.}\)  Therefore if we take \(q = q'+1\) and \(r = r'\) we have that \(m = qn+r\text{,}\) with \(0 \le r \lt n\text{.}\)  On the other hand, \(q'\) and \(r'\) are unique by our inductive hypothesis.  Thus if \(m = qn + r\text{,}\) subtracting \(n\) from both sides of the equation gives us \(m-n = (q-1)n+r\text{.}\) This tells us that \(q\) <em class="emphasis">must</em> equal \(q'+1\) and \(r\) <em class="emphasis">must</em> equal \(r'\text{.}\)  Therefore by the strong principle of mathematical induction, Eulcid's Theorem holds for all positive integers \(m\text{.}\)</p>
