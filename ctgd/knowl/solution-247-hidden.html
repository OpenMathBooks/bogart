<p>We will answer the next part of the problem here! The recurrence for \(b(k,n)\) is exactly the same as the recurrence for \(L(k,n)\text{.}\) Further, \(b(0,0)=1=L(0,0)\text{,}\) \(b(0,n) = 0=L(0,n)\) for \(n&gt;0\text{,}\) and \(b(k,k)=L(k,k) =1\text{.}\) Thus \(b(k,n)\) and \(L(k,n)\) are identical. This and the formula from <a knowl="./knowl/brokenpermutation.html" title="Problem 133">ProblemÂ 133</a> gives one proof that \(b(k,n)=k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!\text{.}\)</p>
<p>A second proof that the change of basis coefficients are Lah numbers goes as follows. \(n^{\overline{k}}\) counts the number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set. One way to determine such an ordered function is to take a broken permutation of the \(k\)-element set into \(n\) or fewer parts, and then take a one-to-one function from the parts to the \(n\)-element set. More informally we assign the parts of the broken permutation to distinct elements of the \(n\)-element set. If the broken permutation has \(i\) parts, the number of ways to do this assignment is the number of \(i\)-element permutations of an \(n\)-element set, \(n^{\underline{i}}\text{.}\) Thus \(n^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^n L(k,i)n^{\underline{i}}\text{.}\) However we can change the upper limit of the sum to \(k\) because \(L(k,i)\) is zero when \(i&gt;k\) and \(n^{\underline{i}}\) is zero when \(i&gt;n\text{.}\) Now we change \(n\) to \(x\) because we have a polynomial equality which is valid for infinitely many of the values of the variable. This gives us \(x^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^k L(k,i)x^{\underline{i}}\text{.}\) Thus \(b(k,i) =
L(k,i)\text{.}\)</p>
