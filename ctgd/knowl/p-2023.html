<p>We can make 10, 11, and 12 cents in postage, but not 13 cents. We can also make 15, 16, 17, and 18, but not 19 cents. However when we try starting with 20 cents, we can make 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,...cents, and so it seems for all \(n\ge 20\text{,}\) we can make \(n\) cents in stamps. Once we know we can make 20 cents through 24 cents, by adding 5 cents to each of these we can get 25 through 29 cents, and so we expect to be able to keep going. However making 29 cents does not depend on our ability to make 28 cents; rather we know we can make 29 cents because we know we can make 24 cents and \(24+5=29\) or we know we can make \(23\) cents and \(23+6=29\text{.}\) Thus it certainly seems as if for all \(n\ge 20\) we can make \(n\) cents in postage.</p>
