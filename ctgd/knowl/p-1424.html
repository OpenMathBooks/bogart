<p>Color an arbitrary vertex; you have \(x\) choices for the color of that vertex. No two vertices adjacent to it are adjacent (otherwise we'd have a cycle), so for for each of them you have \(x-1\) choices of colors. No two vertices adjacent to colored vertices are adjacent to each other, nor is one of them adjacent to two colored vertices (in either case you'd have a cycle), so for each of them you'd have \(x-1\) colors. You can continue this argument until all vertices are colored, so you have \(x(x-1)^{n-1}\) ways to color the vertices.</p>
