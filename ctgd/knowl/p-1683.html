<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/numbermultiorbits4.html" knowl-id="xref-numbermultiorbits4" alt="Problem 299 " title="Problem 299 ">ProblemÂ 299</a> you gave a formula for the number of orbits of a group \(G\) acting on a set \(X\text{.}\) This formula was first worked out by Cauchy in the case of the symmetric group, and then for more general groups by Frobenius. In his pioneering book on Group Theory, Burnside used this result as a lemma, and while he attributed the result to Cauchy and Frobenius in the first edition of his book, in later editions, he did not. Later on, other mathematicians who used his book named the result ``Burnside's Lemma," which is the name by which it is still most commonly known. Let us agree to call this result the Cauchy-Frobenius-Burnside Theorem, or CFB Theorem for short in a compromise between historical accuracy and common usage.</p>
