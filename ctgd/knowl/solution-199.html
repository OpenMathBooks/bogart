<p>A composition of \(n\) is an ordered list of positive numbers that adds to \(n\text{.}\) We wish to show that there are \(2^{n-1}\) compositions of \(n\text{.}\) There is one composition of the number 1, and \(2^{1-1}=1\text{.}\) Now assume inductively that there are \(2^{n-2}\) compositions of the number \({n-1}\text{.}\) From a composition of \(n-1\text{,}\) we can get a composition of \(n\) either by making a new last part of size 1, or by adding one to the last part. Clearly these two operations give different partitions of \(n\text{;}\) what is not so clear is that they give all partitions of \(n\text{,}\) but they do: Either the last part of a partition of \(n\) is 1, in which case it comes from the first kind of operation, or it is larger than one, in which case it comes from the second operation. Thus the number of compositions of \(n\) is twice the number of compositions of \(n-1\text{,}\) and so is \(2\cdot2^{n-2}=2^{n-1}\text{.}\) Therefore the statement that there are \(2^{n-2}\) compositions of \(n-1\) implies the statement that there are \(2^{n-1}\) compositions of \(n\text{.}\) Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, there are \(2^{n-1}\) compositions of \(n\) for every positive integer \(n\text{.}\)</p>
