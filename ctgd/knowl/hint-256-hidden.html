<body><div class="solution"><p>You may have reached the point of assuming that \(2^{k-1} \gt (k-1)^2\) and found yourself wondering how to prove that \(2^k \gt k^2\text{.}\) A natural thing to try is multiplying both sides of \(2^{k-1} \gt (k-1)^2\) by \(2\text{.}\) This ends up giving you \(2^k \gt 2k^2 - 4k +2\text{.}\) Based on previous experience it is natural for you to expect to see how to turn this new right hand side into \(k^2\) but not see how to do it. Here is the hint. You only need to show that the right hand side is greater than or equal to \(k^2\text{.}\) For this purpose you need to show that one of the two \(k^2\)s in \(2k^2\) somehow balances out the \(-4k\text{.}\) See if you can figure out how the fact that you are only considering \(k\)s with \(k \gt b\) can help you out.</p></div></body>
