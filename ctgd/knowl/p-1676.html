<p>We suggested earlier that a quotient principle for multisets might prove useful. The quotient principle came from the sum principle, and we do not have a sum principle for multisets. Such a principle would say that the size of a union of disjoint multisets is the sum of their sizes. We have not yet defined the union of multisets or disjoint multisets, because we haven't needed the ideas until now. We define the <dfn class="terminology">union</dfn> of two multisets \(S\) and \(T\) to be the multiset in which the multiplicity of an element \(x\) is the maximum<a knowl="./knowl/fn-23-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> of the multiplicity of \(x\) in \(S\) and its multiplicity in \(T\) . Similarly, the union of a family of multisets is defined by defining the multiplicity of an element \(x\) to be the maximum of its multiplicities in the members of the family. Two multisets are said to be <dfn class="terminology">disjoint</dfn> if no element is a member of both, that is, if no element has multiplicity one or more in both. Since the size of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities of its members, we immediately get the <dfn class="terminology">sum principle for multisets</dfn>.</p>
