<p>A hydrocarbon molecule is a molecule whose only atoms are either carbon atoms or hydrogen atoms.  In a simple molecular model of a hydrocarbon, a carbon atom will bond to exactly four other atoms and hydrogen atom will bond to exactly one other atom. Such a model is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/butane.html" title="Figure 2.0.8">Figure 2.0.8</a>. We represent a hydrocarbon compound with a graph whose vertices are labelled with C's and H's so that each C vertex has degree four and each H vertex has degree one.  A hydrocarbon is called an “alkane” Common examples are methane (natural gas), butane (one version of which is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/butane.html" title="Figure 2.0.8">Figure 2.0.8</a>)propane, hexane (ordinary gasoline), octane (to make gasoline burn more slowly), etc.</p>

<li>How many vertices are labelled \(H\) in the graph of an alkane with exactly \(n\) vertices labelled \(C\text{?}\)</li>
<li>An alkane is called butane if it has four carbon atoms. Why do we say one version of butane is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/butane.html" title="Figure 2.0.8">Figure 2.0.8</a>?</li>
