<body><span class="solution"><p>We prove by induction on \(n\) that the size of the union of \(n\) disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. We assume that the size of the union of two disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. Now assume \(k&gt;2\) and the size of the union of \(k-1\) disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. Then we may write</p>
\begin{equation*}
|\cup_{i=1}^k S_i|=|\left(\cup_{i=1}^{k-1}S_i\right)\cup
S_k|=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}|S_i|\right) +|S_k|=\sum_{i=1}^k|S_i|.
\end{equation*}
<p>Thus whenever the size of the union of \(k-1\) disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes, then the size of a union of \(k\) disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, the size of the union of \(n\) disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes for all \(n&gt;1\text{.}\) The statement holds trivially when \(n=1\) as well.</p></span></body>
