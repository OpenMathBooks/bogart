<p>We could compute some more values of the limit by going back to the definition in this way, but it seems unlikely that we could get enough data to make a good conjecture. However we have the recurrence, and setting \(q=-1\) in the recurrence gives us <a knowl="./knowl/q-binomial-tab.html" knowl-id="xref-q-binomial-tab" alt="Table 4.2.1 " title="Table 4.2.1 ">TableÂ 4.2.1</a>.  From the table, it is clear that we get binomial coefficients interspersed with 0s in the even numbered rows of our table and repeated binomial coefficients in the odd numbered rows of our table. In particular when \(m+n\) and \(n\) are both even, \(\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=\binom{(m+n)/2}{n/2}\text{,}\) and if \(m+n\) is even and \(n\) is odd, \(\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=0\text{.}\) In our table, at least, if \(m+n\) is odd, it appears that we get \(\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=\binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\text{.}\) In fact, using the recurrence just as we used it to construct the table, we can prove by induction that</p>
\begin{equation*}
\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}0\amp \mbox{if \(mn\) is odd} \\
\binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\amp \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}
