<p>The “Towers of Hanoi” puzzle has three rods rising from a rectangular base with \(n\) rings of different sizes stacked in decreasing order of size on one rod. A legal move consists of moving a ring from one rod to another so that it does not land on top of a smaller ring. If \(m_n\) is the number of moves required to move all the rings from the initial rod to another rod that you choose, give a recurrence for \(m_n\text{.}\) (Hint: suppose you already knew the number of moves needed to solve the puzzle with \(n-1\) rings.)</p>
