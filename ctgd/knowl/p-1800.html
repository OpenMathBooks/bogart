<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/HexNet.html" title="Figure 6.3.2">FigureÂ 6.3.2</a> we see a graph with six vertices. Suppose we have three different kinds of computers that can be placed at the six vertices of the graph to form a network. In how many different ways may the computers be placed? (Two graphs are not different if we can redraw one of the graphs so that it is identical to the other one.) This is equivalent to permuting the vertices in some way so that when we apply the permutation to the endpoints of the edges to get a new edge set, the new edge set is equal to the old one. Such a permutation is called an <dfn class="terminology">automorphism</dfn> of the graph. Then two computer placements are the same if there is an automorphism of the graph that carries one to the other.</p>
