<body><span class="solution"><p>We are asking for the number of orbits of \(D_{17}\) on the set of functions from \([17]\) to \(\{R,B\}\text{.}\) Every function is fixed by the identity. The only functions fixed by a nontrivial rotation are the constant functions. Each flip is around a line from a bead to the space between the two “opposite” beads. The bead the line goes through can be either color, and then the eight beads to the left of this one must be identical to the eight beads to the right of this one. There are \(2^8\) ways to assign beads to the positions on the left, so a flip fixes \(2^9\) functions. Therefore by the CFB theorem, we have</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2\cdot 17}\left(2^{17}+ 17\cdot2^9+16\cdot 2\right)=\frac{2^{16}}{17}+2^8 +\frac{2^4}{17}=16\frac{4097}{17}+256=4112
\end{equation*}
