<p>We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in <a knowl="./knowl/brokenpermutation.html" knowl-id="xref-brokenpermutation" alt="Problem 133 " title="Problem 133 ">Problem 133</a>. Instead of dividing a set up into nonoverlapping parts, we may think of dividing a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>permutation</em> (thought of as a list) of our \(k\) objects up into \(n\) ordered blocks. We will say that a set of ordered lists of elements of a set \(S\) is a <em class="terminology">broken permutation</em> of \(S\) if each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these lists.<span><a knowl="./knowl/fn-7-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-7" alt="Footnote 3.2 " title="Footnote 3.2 "><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span> The number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) blocks is denoted by \(L(k,n)\text{.}\) The number \(L(k,n)\) is called a <em class="terminology">Lah Number</em> and, from our solution to <a knowl="./knowl/brokenpermutation.html" knowl-id="xref-brokenpermutation" alt="Problem 133 " title="Problem 133 ">Problem 133</a>, is equal to \(k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!\text{.}\)</p>
