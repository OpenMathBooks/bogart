<body><span class="solution"><p>To get the coefficient of \(q^k\) in this product, we look at all ways of choosing one summand from each of the infinite series and multiplying them together to get \(q^k\text{,}\) and add all these products up. That is, the coefficient of \(q^k\) is the number of ways of making these choices of one summand from each series so that the product of our choices is \(q^k\text{.}\) This lets us write down as many terms of the series as we want, or as we have patience for!</p></span></body>
