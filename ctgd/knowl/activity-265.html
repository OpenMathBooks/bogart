<article class="introduction" id="introduction-56"><p id="p-1511">As with a two-dimensional figure, it is possible to talk about isometries of a three-dimensional figure. These are distance preserving functions from the figure to itself. The function that reflects the cube in <a knowl="./knowl/cube1.html" knowl-id="xref-cube1" alt="Figure 6.1.3 " title="Figure 6.1.3 ">FigureÂ 6.1.3</a> through a plane halfway between the bottom face and top face exchanges the vertices 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8 of the cube. This function preserves distances between points in the cube. However, it cannot be achieved by a rigid motion of the cube because a rigid motion that takes vertex 1 to vertex 5, vertex 2 to vertex 6, vertex 3 to vertex 7, and vertex 4 to vertex 8 would not return the cube to its original location; rather it would put the bottom of the cube where its top previously was and would put the rest of the cube above that square rather than below it.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-197"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
