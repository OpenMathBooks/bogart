<div class="introduction"><p>Your formula for the Catalan Number can be expressed as a binomial coefficient divided by an integer. Whenever we have a formula that calls for division by an integer, an ideal combinatorial explanation of the formula is one that uses the quotient principle. The purpose of this problem is to find such an explanation using diagonal lattice paths.<a knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> A diagonal lattice path that never goes below the \(y\)-coordinate of its first point is called a <dfn class="terminology">Dyck Path</dfn>. We will call a Dyck Path from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\) a <dfn class="terminology">Catalan Path</dfn> of length \(2n\text{.}\) Thus the number of Catalan Paths of length \(2n\) is the Catalan Number \(C_n\text{.}\)</p></div>
<article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>If a Dyck Path has \(n\) steps (each an upstep or downstep), why do the first \(k\) steps form a Dyck Path for each nonnegative \(k\le n\text{?}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>Thought of as a curve in the plane, a diagonal lattice path can have many local maxima and minima, and can have several absolute maxima and minima, that is, several highest points and several lowest points. What is the \(y\)-coordinate of an absolute minimum point of a Dyck Path starting at \((0,0)\text{?}\)  Explain why a Dyck Path whose rightmost absolute minimum point is its last point is a Catalan Path.</p>

<p>Let \(D\) be the set of all diagonal lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\text{.}\)  (Thus these paths can go below the \(x\)-axis.) Suppose we partition \(D\) by letting \(B_i\) be the set of lattice paths in \(D\) that have \(i\) upsteps (perhaps mixed with some downsteps) following the last absolute minimum.  How many blocks does this partition have?  Give a succinct description of the block \(B_0\text{.}\)</p>

<p>How many upsteps are in a Catalan Path?</p></article><article class="exercise-like difficult"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h6>
<p>We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block \(B_i\) for each \(i\) between \(1\) and \(n\text{.}\)  For now, suppose the value of \(i\text{,}\) while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece \(F\) (for “front”) consists of all steps before the \(i\)th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece \(U\) (for “up”) consists of the \(i\)th upstep.  The piece \(B\) (for “back”) is the portion of the path that follows the \(i\)th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as \(FUB\text{.}\)  Show that the function that takes \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block \(B_i\) of the partition.  (Notice that \(BUF\) can go below the \(x\) axis.)</p>
