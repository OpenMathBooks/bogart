<body><span class="solution"><p>We can line up the identical ping-pong balls and break them into four groups, those of each color, by inserting dividers. If we want to paint at least one in each color, we can choose three of the spaces between the balls in which to insert dividers, so we can paint them in \(\binom{n-1}{k}\text{.}\)  But the problem didn't require us to use each color, so we can put two dividers adjacent to each other. Thus there are \(n+1\) places where we can put the first divider (putting it before all the balls means we use no red, and putting it after all of them means we use no green. Now there are \(n+2\) places where we can put the second divider, including before or after the first, and \(n+3\) places where we can put the third divider. However if we interchange two dividers we still paint the balls before the first divider red, those between then next two white, and so on. Thus \(3!=6\) of these arrangements of balls and dividers correspond to the same paint job, so the number of ways to paint the balls is \(\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{6} =\binom{n+3}{3}\text{.}\) This suggests that another way to think of the problem is to consider \(n+3\) slots in a row, and fill \(n\) of them with balls and \(3\) of them with dividers; since the balls are identical and the dividers might as well be identical, the number of ways to do this is the number of ways to choose the slots that get dividers.</p></span></body>
