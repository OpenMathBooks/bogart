<p>We can always figure out the composition of two permutations of the same set by using the definition of composition, but if we are going to work with a given permutation group again and again, it is worth making the computations once and recording them in a table. For example the group of rotations of the square may be represented as in <a knowl="./knowl/rotationgrouptable.html" knowl-id="xref-rotationgrouptable" alt="Table 6.1.4 " title="Table 6.1.4 ">TableÂ 6.1.4</a>. We list the elements of our group, with the identity first, across the top of the table and down the left side of the table, using the same order both times. Then in the row labeled by the group element \(\sigma\) and the column labelled by the group element \(\varphi\text{,}\) we write the composition \(\sigma\circ \varphi\text{,}\) expressed in terms of the elements we have listed on the top and on the left side. Since a group of permutations is closed under composition, the result \(\sigma\circ \varphi\) will always be expressible as one of these elements.</p>
