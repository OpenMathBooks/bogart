<p>The action has been defined for us, so all we need to show is that it is indeed an action. We must show that for each permutation \(\sigma\) in \(D_4\text{,}\) \(\overline{\sigma}\) is a permutation of the two-element sets of \([4]\) and in addition we must show that \(\overline{\sigma}\circ\overline{\tau}= \overline{\sigma\circ\tau}\text{.}\) If \(\overline{\sigma}(\{i,j\})=\overline{\sigma}(\{h,k\})\text{,}\) then either \(\sigma(i)=\sigma(h)\) and \(\sigma(j)=\sigma(k)\) or else \(\sigma(i)=\sigma(k)\) and \(\sigma(j) =\sigma(h)\text{.}\) Since \(\sigma\) is a permutation, in the first case we get \(i=h\) and \(j=k\text{,}\) so that \(\{i,j\}= \{h,k\}\text{,}\) and in the second case we get that \(i=k\) and \(j=h\) so that \(\{i,j\} = \{k,h\} =\{h,k\}\text{.}\) Thus in either case \(\{i,j\} = \{h,k\}\text{,}\) so that \(\overline{\sigma}\) a one-to-one function from the finite set of two element subsets of \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) to itself, and so it is a permutation.</p>
