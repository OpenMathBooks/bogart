<body><span class="solution"><p>First, we will prove this by induction. The number of prime factors of \(2\) is 1, which is less than or equal to \(\log_2 2=1\text{.}\) Now assume that the number of prime factors of any number \(k\) greater than 1 and less than \(n\) is no more than \(\log_2 k\text{.}\) If \(n\) is prime, then its number of prime factors is less than or equal to \(\log_2 n\text{.}\) Otherwise \(n\) is a product of two factors, \(n=mk\text{.}\) Then by our inductive hypothesis, the number of prime factors of \(m\) is less than or equal to \(\log_2 m\) and the number of prime factors of \(k\) is less than or equal to \(\log_2 k\text{.}\) But the number of prime factors of the product is the sum of the number of prime factors of each factor, so the number of prime factors of \(n\) is no more than \(\log_2 m +\log_2 k=\log_2 mk= \log_2 n\text{.}\) Thus statement that the number of prime factors of any number \(k\) between 2 and \(n-1\) inclusive is no more than \(\log_2 k\text{,}\) implies the statement that the number of prime factors of \(n\) is no more than \(\log_2 n\text{.}\) Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the number of prime factors of \(n\) is less than or equal to \(\log_2 n\) for all integers \(n\ge 2\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
