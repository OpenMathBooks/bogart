<p>One of the most spectacular applications of the exponential formula is also the reason why, when we regard a combinatorial structure as a set of building block structures, we call the building block structures <dfn class="terminology">connected</dfn>. In <a href="InductionRecursion.html" class="xref" alt="Chapter 2 Applications of Induction and Recursion in Combinatorics and Graph Theory" title="Chapter 2 Applications of Induction and Recursion in Combinatorics and Graph Theory">Chapter 2</a> we introduced the idea of a connected graph and in <a knowl="./knowl/connectedanddisconnected.html" knowl-id="xref-connectedanddisconnected" alt="Problem 104 " title="Problem 104 ">Problem 104</a> we saw examples of graphs which were connected and were not connected. A subset \(C\) of the vertex set of a graph is called a <dfn class="terminology">connected component</dfn> of the graph if </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>every vertex in \(C\) is connected to every other vertex in that set by a walk whose vertices lie in \(C\text{,}\) and</p></li>
<li><p>no other vertex in the graph is connected by a walk to any vertex in \(C\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
