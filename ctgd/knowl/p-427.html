<p>We now have many methods for solving this problem. Perhaps the easiest is to list all \((4n)\) people and take them in groups of four for doubles matches, with the first two in a group of four as one team and the second two as another team. We note that interchanging the \(n\) blocks of 4 does not change the matches, nor does interchanging the two people on a team nor interchanging the two teams. Thus we have \((4n)!/n!2^{3n}\) ways to arrange the matches. If we are to say who serves first on each team, we might as well say it is the first of the two listed, so now we have \((4n)!/n!2^n\) ways to arrange the matches.</p>
