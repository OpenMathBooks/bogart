<p>(You may have already done this problem in <a knowl="./knowl/dihedral1.html" title="Problem 255">Problem 255</a>, in which case you need not do it again!) In <a knowl="./knowl/dihedral1.html" title="Problem 255">Problem 255</a>, if a rigid motion of three-dimensional space returns the square to its original position, in how many places can vertex number one land? Once the location of vertex number one is decided, how many possible locations are there for vertex two? Once the locations of vertex one and vertex two are decided, how many locations are there for vertex three? Answer the same question for vertex four. What does this say about the relationship between the four rotations and four flips described above and the permutations you described in <a knowl="./knowl/dihedral1.html" title="Problem 255">Problem 255</a>?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_groups-permgroups.html#activity-260">in-context</a></span>
