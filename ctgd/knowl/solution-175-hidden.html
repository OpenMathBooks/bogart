<body><span class="solution"><p>If a graph has no vertices, then the sum of the degrees of the vertices is 0, which is twice the number of edges. Now suppose that whenever a graph has \(n-1\) vertices, the sum of the degrees is twice the number of edges. Let \(G\) be a graph with \(n\) vertices. Delete one vertex \(x\) and all edges it is incident with. By our inductive hypothesis the sum of the degrees of the vertices of the resulting graph is twice the number of edges. Now replace the vertex \(x\) and add in the edges connecting it to other vertices in the graph. Each time you add in an edge, you increase the degree of \(x\) by one and of one other vertex by one. Finally add in any edges connecting \(x\) to itself. Each of these increases the degree of \(x\) by two. Thus for each edge we added, the sum of the degrees of the vertices increased by two, so the sum of the degrees of the vertices of \(G\) is still twice the number of edges. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, for all nonnegative integers \(n\text{,}\) if a graph has \(n\) vertices, then the sum of the degrees of its vertices is even.</p></span></body>
