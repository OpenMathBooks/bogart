<p>The formula you have given in <a knowl="./knowl/inclusion-exclusionunion.html" knowl-id="xref-inclusion-exclusionunion" alt="Problem 230 " title="Problem 230 ">ProblemÂ 230</a> is often called <b class="terminology">the principle of inclusion and exclusion</b> for unions of sets. The reason is the pattern in which the formula first adds (includes) all the sizes of the sets, then subtracts (excludes) all the sizes of the intersections of two sets, then adds (includes) all the sizes of the intersections of three sets, and so on.   Notice that we haven't yet proved the principle. There are a variety of proofs.  Perhaps one of the most straightforward (though not the most elegant) is an iductive proof that relies on the fact that</p>
\begin{equation*}
A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_{n-1}\right) \cup A_n
\end{equation*}
<p>and the formula for the size of a union of two sets.</p>
