<p>Write down the picture (using \(x\)s) of a tree on five vertices with two vertices of degree one, of one with three vertices of degree one, and with four vertices of degree 1. Factor \(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5\) out of the picture and look at what is left.  How is it related to your vertices of degree one? Now remove the vertices of degree 1 from the tree and write down the picture of the tree that remains.  What is special about the vertices of degree 1 of that tree. (You can just barely learn something from this with five vertex trees, so you might want to experiment a bit with six or seven vertex trees.)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_genfns-idea.html#hint-176">in-context</a></span>
