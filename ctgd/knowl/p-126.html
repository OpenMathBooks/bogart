<p>As another example how standard mathematical language relates to counting problems, <a knowl="./knowl/countingfunctions.html" title="Problem 7">Problem 7</a> explicitly asked you to relate the idea of counting functions to the question of <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" title="Problem 6">Problem 6</a>. You have probably learned in algebra or calculus how to draw graphs in the Cartesian plane of functions from a set of numbers to a set of numbers. You may recall how we can determine whether a graph is a graph of a function by examining whether each vertical straight line crosses the graph at most one time. You might also recall how we can determine whether such a function is one-to-one by examining whether each horizontal straight line crosses the graph at most one time. The functions we deal with will often involve objects which are not numbers, and will often be functions from one finite set to another. Thus graphs in the cartesian plane will often not be available to us for visualizing functions.</p>
