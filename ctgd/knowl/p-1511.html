<p>We can use three of the vertices of a square to set up a rectangular coordinate system, and every point is determined by its signed distances from the two coordinate lines. But the distance of a point from a line is simply the height of a triangle given by that point and two points on the line. All unsigned distances of points in the square from the coordinate lines are determined by the distances of points from the three points we use to construct our coordinate system. We can set up our coordinate system so all distances of points in the square from the coordinate lines are positive. Therefore each point in the square is determined by its distances from the three points we have chosen. But a distance preserving map must take corners of the square to corners of the square (it has to preserve diagonal distances). Therefore any isometry is determined by what it does to the corners of the square. But two adjacent corners must go to two adjacent corners for distances to be preserved and so a corner and the two edges adjacent to it must be mapped to a corner and the two edges adjacent to it. There are four choices for the corner that we map to and two choices of which edges go to which once the corner is chosen. Thus there are 8 choices for an isometry of the square. Each element of the dihedral group of the square is a permutation of the corners determined by a rigid motion, and thus an isometry. Thus the dihedral group can also be thought of as the permutations of the vertices (corners) of a square induced by isometries.</p>
