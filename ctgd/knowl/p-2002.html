<p>One way of looking at the principle of mathematical induction is that it tells us that if we know the “first” case of a theorem and we can derive each other case of the theorem from a smaller case, then the theorem is true in all cases. However the particular way in which we stated the theorem is rather restrictive in that it requires us to derive each case from the immediately preceding case. This restriction is not necessary, and removing it leads us to a more general statement of the principal of mathematical induction which people often call the <em class="terminology">strong principle of mathematical induction</em>. It states:</p>
