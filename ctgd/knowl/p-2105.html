<p>The second essential feature of our examples of products of EGFs is that products of EGFs seem to count structures on ordered pairs of two disjoint sets (or more generally on \(k\)-tuples of mutually disjoint sets). For example, we can determine a five coloring of a set \(S\) by partitioning it in all possible ways into two sets and coloring the first set in the pair with our first two colors and our second pair with the last three colors. Or we can partition our set in all possible ways into five parts and color part i with our ith color. We don't have to do the same thing to each part of our partition; for example, we could define a derangement on one part and an identity permutation on the other; this defines a permutation on the set we are partitioning, and we have already noted that every permutation arises in this way.</p>
