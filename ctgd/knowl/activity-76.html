<article class="introduction" id="introduction-26"><p id="p-449">An inductive definition of \(a^n\) for nonnegative \(n\) is given by \(a^0=1\) and \(a^n=aa^{n-1}\text{.}\) (Notice the similarity to the inductive definition of \(n!\text{.}\)) We remarked above that inductive definitions often give us easy proofs of useful facts. Here we apply this inductive definition to prove two useful facts about exponents that you have been using almost since you learned the meaning of exponents.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-75"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p id="p-450">Use this definition to prove the rule of exponents \(a^{m+n}=a^ma^n\) for nonnegative \(m\) and \(n\text{.}\)</p>

In some sense, it doesn't matter which you choose to induct on, though inducting on the sum would look more complicated. For most people inducting on \(n\) fits their way of working with exponents best.</p></span></span></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-76"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>

(a^m)^n\text{.}\)</p>

In one case, you are likely to need the rule \((cd)^n=c^n d^n\)(, which we haven't proved. (However, you might be able to prove that by induction!) In either case, you may find part (a) handy.</p></span></span></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_induction-examples.html#activity-76">in-context</a></span>
