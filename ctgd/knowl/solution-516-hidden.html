<p>We want the number of orbits of the set of proper colorings under the action of the group of automorphisms of the graph. An automorphism \(\sigma\) maps vertex 1 to any of six vertices. Vertex 2 can be mapped to any of the four vertices adjacent to the image of vertex 1. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 2, so it must be mapped to a vertex adjacent to the images of both vertex 1 and vertex 2; by checking cases you can see that there are always exactly two vertices adjacent to the images of vertex 1 and vertex 2, and mapping vertex 3 to either of these vertices preserves all the edges among vertices 1, 2, and 3. However each of the other three vertices is adjacent to exactly two vertices of the set \(\{1,2,3\}\text{,}\) and thus it must be mapped to the unique vertex adjacent to the corresponding two of \(\sigma(1)\text{,}\) \(\sigma(2)\) and \(\sigma(3)\text{.}\) (It is always the case that each vertex is adjacent to exactly two of these, as you can see by considering the cases with \(\sigma(1)=1\text{.}\)) Thus there are \(6\cdot4\cdot2=48\) elements in the group. Now to apply the CFB theorem we would need to know how many proper colorings are fixed by each group element, so we would need to know what the group elements are. We have observed that a permutation that preserves the edges is determined by where the triangle \(\{1,2,3\}\) goes. We can see eight triangles in the graph, triangles of the form \(\{i,i+1,i+2\}\text{,}\) where we identify 7 with 1 and 8 with 2, and the triangles \(\{1,3,5\}\) and \(\{2,4,6\}\text{.}\) We can map the set \(\{1,2,3\}\) to any of these eight sets by six one-to-one maps, so each group element is determined uniquely by one of these mappings. However focusing on these triangles makes our job here simpler in another way. In a proper coloring, vertices 1, 2, and 3 must be colored differently. We have four choices for the color of vertex 1, three different ones for vertex 2 and two still different ones for vertex 3, so there are 24 ways to color this triangle. Clearly the only difference among these ways is the actual names of the colors. That is, we can assume that vertex 1 is colored red, vertex 2 is colored blue and vertex 3 is colored green, then determine the proper colorings starting with these three colors, and up to changing the names of the colors, we will have determined all the proper colorings. Then we can ask which group elements fix a coloring rather than which colorings are fixed by a group element. This turns out to be easier. Let us write \(RBGRBG\) for the coloring that colors vertices 1 and 4 red, two and five blue, and three and six green. An examination of the figure shows that this is a proper coloring. In fact, it is the only proper coloring that starts \(RBG\) and uses only three colors. Suppose we were to use a fourth color, \(Y\text{.}\) Then among vertices 4, 5, and 6, it could be used in just one place, because those three vertices are mutually adjacent. Each of the other two vertices is adjacent to two of the original three vertices colored \(RBG\text{,}\) and so there is only one color available to use on it. In summary, the colorings that start \(RBG\) are </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>\(RBGRBG\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(RBGYBG\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(RBGRYG\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(RBGRBY\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol>
<p> Thus for any of the 24 choices of colorings of the first three vertices, there are four ways to complete it to a proper coloring of the whole graph, so there are 96 proper colorings of the graph. Among the ones that start RGB, let us analyze which group elements fix them. Note that the 2-cycles \((1\ 4)\text{,}\) \((2\ 5)\) and \((3\ 6)\) are all permutations that fix coloring one. Further, interchanging vertices 1 and 4 does not change the endpoints of any edges, nor does interchanging 2 and 5 nor 3 and 6. So all these two cycles are automorphisms of the graph. A composition of automorphisms must be an automorphism(this follows directly from the definition of automorphism) and so the eight permutations \(\iota\text{,}\) \((1\ 4)\text{,}\) \((2\ 5)\text{,}\) \((3\ 6)\text{,}\) \((1\ 4)(2\ 5)\text{,}\) \((1\ 4)
(3\ 6)\text{,}\) \((2\ 5)(3\ 6)\text{,}\) and \((1\ 4)(2\ 5)(3\ 6)\) all are automorphisms of the graph, and they are all in the subgroup of the automorphism group that fixes the coloring in <a knowl="./knowl/coloring1.html" title="Item a">coloring a</a>. Any permutation not in the list will take some vertex to a vertex of another color, and so the eight permutations we listed are the subgroup fixing the coloring in <a knowl="./knowl/coloring1.html" title="Item a">coloring a</a>. The subgroup fixing the coloring in <a knowl="./knowl/coloring2.html" title="Item b">coloring b</a> is \(\iota\text{,}\) \((1\ 3)\text{,}\) \((2\ 4)\text{,}\) and \((1\ 3)(2\ 4)\text{.}\) The subgroups fixing the colorings in <a knowl="./knowl/coloring3.html" title="Item c">coloring c</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/coloring4.html" title="Item d">coloring d</a> also have size 4. Thus there are \(8+12=20\) pairs of a coloring with \(R\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(G\text{,}\) in that order, on vertices 1, 2, and 3 and an automorphism fixing that coloring. Since there are \(4\cdot3\cdot2=24\) ways to color vertices 1, 2, and 3 properly, and each gives rise to 20 pairs of a proper coloring and an automorphism fixing that coloring, there are \(20\cdot24=480\) such pairs. Since the automorphism group has size 48, this means that there are 10 proper colorings of this graph, up to automorphisms. Note that we did not really use the CFB theorem, though we did use the fact that its formula is proved by dividing the number of ordered pairs of a set member and a group element fixing that member by the size of the group.</p>
