<p>We found four permutations that correspond to rotations of the square. In <a knowl="./knowl/dihedral1.html" knowl-id="xref-dihedral1" alt="Problem 255 " title="Problem 255 ">ProblemÂ 255</a> you found four permutations that correspond to flips of the square in space. One flip fixes the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 3 and interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 2 and 4. Let us denote it by \(\varphi_{1|3}\text{.}\) One flip fixes the vertices in the positions labeled 2 and 4 and interchanges those in the positions labeled 1 and 3. Let us denote it by \(\varphi{2|4}\text{.}\) One flip interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 2 and also interchanges those in the places labeled 3 and 4. Let us denote it by \(\varphi_{12|34}\text{.}\) The fourth flip interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 4 and interchanges those in the places labeled 2 and 3. Let us denote it by \(\varphi_{14|23}\text{.}\) Notice that \(\varphi_{1|3}\) is a permutation that takes the vertex in place 1 to the vertex in place 1 and the vertex in place 3 to the vertex in place 3, while \(\varphi_{12|34}\) is a permutation that takes the edge between places 1 and 2 to the edge between places 2 and 1 (which is the same edge) and takes the edge between places 3 and 4 to the edge between places 4 and 3 (which is the same edge). This should help to explain the similarity in the notation for the two different kinds of flips.</p>
