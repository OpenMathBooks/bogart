<p>Let \(C\) be the set of all vertices connected by a walk to a vertex \(x\text{.}\) Then </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>Each pair of vertices \(u\) and \(v\) in \(C\) is connected by the walk that goes from \(u\) to \(x\) and then from \(x\) to \(v\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If a vertex \(w\) is connected by a walk to a vertex \(v\) in \(C\text{,}\) then it is connected to \(x\) by the walk that goes from \(w\) to \(v\) and then from \(v\) to \(x\text{.}\)  Thus no  vertex \(w\) in the graph other than a member of \(C\) is connected by a walk to any vertex in \(C\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore \(C\) is a connected component containing \(x\text{.}\) If connected component \(D\) contained \(x\text{,}\) then every vertex in \(D\) would be connected by a walk to \(x\) and then by a walk from \(x\) to \(v\) for each other vertex in \(C\text{,}\) and similarly, each vertex in \(C\) would be connected to each vertex in \(D\text{.}\) Thus by the definition of connected component, \(C\) and \(D\) would have to be the same set. Therefore each vertex lies in one and only one connected component.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="expogenfun.html#solution-655">in-context</a></span>
