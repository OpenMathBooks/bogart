<p>This solution is taken largely from the book <span class="booktitle">Introduction to Combinatorics</span> by Ioan Tomescu (published in London by Collet's in 1975). Tomescu calls a collection of rows in a Young diagram a “trapezoid” if each row contains one less cell than the row above and the number of cells in the rows above and below the trapezoid differ by two or more from the number of cells in rows of the trapezoid. Thus in (8,6,5,4,2,1) we have 3 trapezoids, the first row, the next three rows, and the last two. Since we are dealing with partitions with distinct parts, we don't have to worry about how two equal rows affect the definition of a trapezoid. We will describe a way to transform a partition with an even number of distinct parts into a partition with an odd number of distinct parts and vice versa.</p>
