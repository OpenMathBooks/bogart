<p>Recall that when you were asked in <a knowl="./knowl/twocolorsofbeads.html" knowl-id="xref-twocolorsofbeads" alt="Problem 45 " title="Problem 45 ">Problem 45</a> to find the number of ways to place two red beads and two blue beads at the corners of a square free to move in three-dimensional space, you were not able to apply the quotient principle to answer the question. Instead you had to see that you could divide the set of six lists of two \(R\)s and two \(B\)s into two sets, one of size two in which the \(R\)s and \(B\)s alternated and one of size four in which the two reds (and therefore the two blues) would be side-by-side on the square. Saying that the square is free to move in space is equivalent to saying that two arrangements of beads on the square are equivalent if a member of the dihedral group carries one arrangement to the other. Thus an important ingredient in the analysis of such problems will be how a group can act on colorings of a set of vertices. We can describe the coloring of the square in <a knowl="./knowl/colored-square.html" knowl-id="xref-colored-square" alt="Figure 6.2.2 " title="Figure 6.2.2 ">Figure 6.2.2</a> as the function \(f\) with</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(1)=R,\; f(2)=R, \; f(3)=B,\;\text{ and }\;f(4)=B\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>but it is more compact and turns out to be more suggestive to represent the coloring in <a knowl="./knowl/colored-square.html" knowl-id="xref-colored-square" alt="Figure 6.2.2 " title="Figure 6.2.2 ">Figure 6.2.2</a> as the set of ordered pairs</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
(1,R), (2,R), (3,B), (4,B)\tag{6.3}
\end{equation}
