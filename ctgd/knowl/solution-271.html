<p>Removing the largest part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts gives us a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and and partitions of numbers \(k'\) between \(n-1\) and \(k-1\) into \(n-1\) parts of size at most \(k-k'\text{.}\) (Removing the largest part gives us such a partition, and adjoining a part of size \(k-k'\) to such a partition gives us a partition of \(k\) with \(n\) parts.)</p>
<p>Removing one from each part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts gives us a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and and partitions \(k-n\) into \(n\) or fewer parts. (Removing one from each part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts gives us such a partition, and, given such a partition, we get a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts by adding one to each part and then creating enough parts of size 1 to have \(n\) parts.)</p>
