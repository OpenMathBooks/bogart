<p>Every involution is a unique product of disjoint two-cycles and one-cycles, so we can think of it as an ordered pair of whose first entry is a set of disjoint two-cycles and whose second element is a set of disjoint one-cycles. The value of a set of two-cycles is the union of their support sets and the value of a set of one-cycles is the union of their support sets. Then the EGF for involutions is the product of the EGF for permutations that are the product of only disjoint two-cycles and the EGF for permutations that are the product of only disjoint one-cycles (i.e. identity permutations).</p>
<p>We noted in the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/derangementsand1cycles.html" title="Problem 391">ProblemÂ 391</a> that every permutation is the product of a derangement (on the elements that are not fixed by the permutation) and a product of one cycles (on the elements that are fixed by the permutation). Thus we can think of every permutation as an ordered pair consisting of a derangement and a product of one-cycles, and the product principle tells us that the EGF for all permutations is the product of the EGF for derangements and the EGF for identity permutations.</p>
