<p>Draw five circles labeled Al, Sue, Don, Pam, and Jo. Find a way to draw red and green lines between people so that every pair of people is joined by a line and there is neither a triangle consisting entirely of red lines or a triangle consisting of green lines. What does <a knowl="./knowl/R_3_3_.html" title="Problem 65">Problem 65</a> tell you about the possibility of doing this with six people's names? What does this problem say about the conclusion of <a knowl="./knowl/R_3_3_.html" title="Problem 65">Problem 65</a> holding when there are five people in our set rather than six?</p>
