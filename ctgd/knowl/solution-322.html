<p>If we have one vertex of degree four, the rest have degree one. So our picture is \(x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_i^3\) . If there is a vertex of degree three, then one vertex must have degree two and the rest must have degree 1, because the sum of the degrees must be 8. Thus the picture must be \(x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_i^2 x_j\text{,}\) where \(i\) is the vertex of degree three and \(j\) is the vertex of degree two. If it has no vertices of degree more than 3, then it must have three vertices of degree two in order for the sum of the degrees to be eight. Thus its picture is \(x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_ix_jx_k\text{,}\) where \(i\text{,}\) \(j\text{,}\) and \(k\) are the vertices of degree two.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_genfns-idea.html#solution-322">in-context</a></span>
