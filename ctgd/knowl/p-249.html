<p>The quotient principle is really just a restatement of the product principle, but thinking about it as a principle in its own right often leads us to find solutions to problems. Notice that it does not always give us a formula for the number of blocks of a partition; it only works when all the blocks have the same size. In <a href="groupsonsets.html" class="xref" title="Chapter 6: Groups acting on sets">ChapterÂ 6</a>, we develop a way to solve problems with different block sizes in cases where there is a good deal of symmetry in the problem. (The roundness of the table was a symmetry in the problem of people at a table; the fact that we can order the sets in any order is the symmetry in the problem of counting \(k\)-element subsets.)</p>
