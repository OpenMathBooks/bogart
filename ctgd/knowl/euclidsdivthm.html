<p>One of the most powerful statements in elementary number theory is Euclid's Division Theorem.<a knowl="./knowl/fn-25-hidden.html" title="Footnote B.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> This states that if \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, then there are unique nonnegative intergers \(q\) and \(r\) with \(0 \le r \lt n\text{,}\) such that \(m = nq + r\text{.}\) The number \(q\) is called the quotient and the number \(r\) is called the remainder. In computer science it is common to denote \(r\) by \(m \mod n\text{.}\) In elementary school you learned how to use long division to find \(q\) and \(r\text{.}\) However, it is unlikely that anyone ever proved for you that for any pair of positive intgers, \(m\) and \(n\text{,}\) there is such a pair of nonnegative numbers \(q\) and \(r\text{.}\) You now have the tools needed to prove this. Do so.</p>
