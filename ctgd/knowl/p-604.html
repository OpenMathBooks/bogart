<p>If a graph has no edges, then the sum of the degrees of the vertices is 0, which is twice the number of edges. Now suppose that whenever a graph has \(n-1\) edges, the sum of the degrees of the vertices is twice the number of edges. Let \(G\) be a graph with \(n\) edges, and delete an edge from \(G\) to get \(G'\text{.}\) The the sum of the degrees of \(G'\) is \(2(n-1)\text{,}\) and adding the edge back into \(G'\) to get \(G\) either increases the degrees of exactly two vertices by one each or increases the degree of one vertex by 2. Thus the sum of the degrees of the vertices of \(G\) is \(2n\text{,}\) which is twice the number of edges. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, for all nonnegative integers \(n\text{,}\) if a graph has \(n\) edges, then the sum of the degrees of the vertices is twice the number of edges.</p>
