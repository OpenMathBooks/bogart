<p>Show that every power of \(x+1\) is expressible as a sum of numerical multiples of powers of \(x\text{.}\) Now show that every power of \(x\) (and thus every polynomial in \(x\)) is a sum of numerical multiples (some of which could be negative) of powers of \(x+1\text{.}\) This means that the powers of \(x+1\) are a basis for the space of polynomials as well. Describe the change of basis coefficients that we use to express the binomial powers \((x+1)^n\) in terms of the ordinary \(x^j\) explicitly. Find the change of basis coefficients we use to express the ordinary powers \(x^n\) in terms of the binomial powers \((x+1)^k\text{.}\)</p>
