<p>Suppose that a company has a main office in one city and regional offices in other cities. Most of the communication in the company is between the main office and the regional offices, so the company wants to find a spanning tree that minimizes not the total cost of all the edges, but rather the cost of communication between the main office and each of the regional offices. It is not clear that such a spanning tree even exists. This problem is a special case of the following. We have a connected graph with nonnegative numbers assigned to its edges. (In this situation these numbers are often called weights.) The <dfn class="terminology">(weighted) length</dfn> of a path in the graph is the sum of the weights of its edges. The <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> between two vertices is the least (weighted) length of any path between the two vertices. Given a vertex \(v\text{,}\) we would like to know the distance between \(v\) and each other vertex, and we would like to know if there is a spanning tree in \(G\) such that the length of the path in the spanning tree from \(v\) to each vertex \(x\) is the distance from \(v\) to \(x\) in \(G\text{.}\)</p>
