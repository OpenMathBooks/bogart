<p>Exponential generating functions turn out to be quite useful in advanced work in combinatorics. One reason why is that it is often possible to give a combinatorial interpretation to the composition of two exponential generating functions. In particular, if \(f(x) =
\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}\) and \(g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j \frac{x^j}{j!}\text{,}\) it makes sense to form the composition \(f(g(x))\) because in so doing we need add together only finitely many terms in order to find the coefficient of \(\frac{x^n}{n!}\) in \(f(g(x))\) since in the EGF \(g(x)\) the dummy variable \(j\) starts at 1. Since our study of combinatorial structures has not been advanced enough to give us applications of a general formula for the composition of the EGF, we will not give here the combinatorial interpretation of this composition. However we have seen some examples where one particular composition can be applied. Namely, if \(f(x) = e^x = \exp(x)\text{,}\) then \(f(g(x)) =\ exp(g(x))\) is well defined when \(b_0=0\text{.}\) We have seen three examples in which an EGF is \(e^{f(x)}\) where \(f(x)\) is another EGF. There is a fourth example in which the exponential function is slightly hidden.</p>
