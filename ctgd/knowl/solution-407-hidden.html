<body><div class="solution"><p>Since \(v\) is in \(B_1\text{,}\) there is a walk from \(v_1\) to \(v\text{.}\) Since there is a walk from every vertex in \(B_1\) to \(v_1\text{,}\) there is a walk from every vertex in in \(B_1\) to \(v\text{.}\) But there is a walk from \(v\) to \(v_2\) since \(v\in B_2\text{.}\) Thus there is a walk from every vertex in \(B_1\) to \(v_2\text{.}\) Then by our description of \(B_2\) just before the problem, every vertex in \(B_1\) is also in \(B_2\text{.}\) A similar argument shows that every vertex in \(B_2\) is also in \(B_1\text{.}\) Thus \(B_1=B_2\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
