<p>If you are taking a course, your instructor will choose problems for you to work on based on the prerequisites for and goals of the course. If you are reading the book on your own, I recommend that you try all the problems in a section you want to cover. Try to do the problems with bullets, but by all means don't restrict yourself to them. Often a bulleted problem makes more sense if you have done some of the easier motivational problems that come before it. If, after you've tried it, you want to skip over a problem without a bullet or circle, you should not miss out on much by not doing that problem. Also, if you don't find the problems in a section with no bullets interesting, you can skip them, understanding that you may be skipping an entire branch of combinatorial mathematics! And no matter what, read the textual material that comes before, between, and immediately after problems you are working on!</p>
