<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/alphabetdigraph.html" title="Figure A.1.1">Figure A.1.1</a> we illustrate another kind of graph, a “directed graph” or “digraph” of the ``comes before in alphabetical order" relation on the letters \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(c\text{,}\) and \(d\text{.}\) To draw a <dfn class="terminology">directed graph</dfn> of a relation on a set \(S\text{,}\) we draw a circle (or dot, if we prefer), which we call a <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn>, for each element of the set, we usually label the vertex with the set element it corresponds to, and we draw an arrow from the vertex for \(a\) to that for \(b\) if \(a\) is related to \(b\text{,}\) that is, if the ordered pair \((a,b)\) is in our relation. We call such an arrow an <dfn class="terminology">edge</dfn> or a <dfn class="terminology">directed edge</dfn>. We draw the arrow from \(a\) to \(b\text{,}\) for example, because \(a\) comes before \(b\) in alphabetical order. We try to choose the locations where we draw our vertices so that the arrows capture what we are trying to illustrate as well as possible. Sometimes this entails redrawing our directed graph several times until we think the arrows capture the relationship well.</p>
