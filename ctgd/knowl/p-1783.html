<p>We are asking for a generating function for the orbits of a colored 12-gon under the action of \(D_{12}\text{.}\) To apply the PÃ³lya-Redfield theorem we need the cycle index for \(D_{12}\text{.}\) If \(\rho\) is a 30 degree rotation, then \(\rho\text{,}\) \(\rho^5\text{,}\) \(\rho^7\) and \(\rho^{11}\) are 12-cycles. The elements \(\rho^2\) and \(\rho^{10}\) are products of two six-cycles. The elements \(\rho^3\) and \(\rho^9\) are products of three four-cycles. The elements \(\rho^4\) and \(\rho^8\) are products of four three-cycles. The element \(\rho^6\) is a product of six two-cycles. The element \(\iota=\rho^0\) is a product of 12 one-cycles. There are six flips around axes through opposite vertices; each is a product of five two-cycles and two one-cycles. There are six flips around axes perpendicular to two opposite sides; each is a product of six two-cycles. Summarizing this in the cycle index, we write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
Z(G,S)  =\amp \frac{1}{24}\left( z_1^{12}+z_2^6+ 2z_3^4+ 2z_4^3 + 2z_6^2 +4z_{12} +
6z_2^5z_1^2 + 6z_2^6\right)\\
=\amp \frac{1}{24}\left( z_1^{12}+7z_2^6+ 2z_3^4+ 2z_4^3 +
2z_6^2 +4z_{12} + 6z_2^5z_1^2\right).
