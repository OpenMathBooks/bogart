<body><span class="solution"><p>Exactly one. Suppose there were two distinct paths \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) from \(x\) to \(y\text{.}\) As they leave \(x\text{,}\) they might leave on the same edge or on different edges. However, since they are different, there must be some first vertex \(x'\) on both paths so that when leave \(x'\) (as we go from \(x\) to \(y\)), they leave on different edges. Then since they must both enter \(y\text{,}\) there must be some first vertex \(y'\text{,}\) following \(x'\) on both paths as we go from \(x\) to \(y\text{,}\) such that the two paths enter \(y'\) on two different edges. Then the portion of path 1 from \(x'\) to \(y'\) followed by the portion of path 2 from \(y'\) to \(x'\) will be a cycle. This is impossible in a tree, so the supposition that there were two distinct paths is impossible.</p></span></body>
