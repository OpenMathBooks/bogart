<p>There are quite a few concepts that are developed in this book. Since most of the intellectual content is in the problems, it is natural that definitions of concepts will often be within problems. When you come across an unfamiliar term in a problem, it is likely it was defined earlier. Look it up in the index, and with luck (hopefully no luck will really be needed!) you will be able to find the definition.</p>
