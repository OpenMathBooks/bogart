<body><span class="solution"><p>The \(k\)th child is either in a circle by him/her self, and there are \(c(k-1,n-1)\) ways for this to happen, or is in a circle with some other children. In the second case child \(i\) can be to the immediate right of any of the other \(k-1\) children, so there are \((k-1)c(k-1,n)\) ways for this to happen. Thus \(c(k,n)=c(k-1,n-1)
+(k-1)c(k-1,n)\text{.}\) This recurrence is almost the same as the recurrence for \(s(k,n)\text{,}\) except it has a plus sign where the recurrence for the Stirling numbers of the first kind has a minus sign. Further \(c(k,1)=(k-1)!\) and \(c(k,k)=1\text{,}\) which agrees, except for sign, with the Stirling numbers of the first kind. If we experiment with applying the recurrence, we see that whenever we use it to compute \(c(k,n)\text{,}\) we get that \(c(k,n)=|s(k,n)|\text{.}\) It is now straightforward to prove by induction that \(c(k,n)=|s(k,n)|\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
