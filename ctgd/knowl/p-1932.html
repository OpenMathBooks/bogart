<p>When people sit around a round table, each list is equivalent to itself: if List1 and List 2 are identical, then everyone has the same person to the right in both lists (including the first person in the list being to the right of the last person). To see the symmetric property of the equivalence of seating arrangements, if List1 and List2 are different, but everyone has the same person to the right when they sit according to List2 as when they sit according to List1, then everybody better have the same person to the right when they sit according to List1 as when they sit according to List2.</p>
