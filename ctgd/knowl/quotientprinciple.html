<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosekfinal.html" title="Part 39.d">Problems 39.d</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablepartition.html" title="Problem 41">41</a>, you have been using the product principle in a new way. One of the ways in which we previously stated the product principle was “If we partition a set into \(m\) blocks each of size \(n\text{,}\) then the set has size \(m\cdot n\text{.}\)” In <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosekfinal.html" title="Part 39.d">Problems 39.d</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablepartition.html" title="Problem 41">41</a> we knew the size \(p\) of a set \(P\) of permutations of a set, and we knew we had partitioned \(P\) into some unknown number of blocks, each of a certain known size \(r\text{.}\) If we let \(q\) stand for the number of blocks, what does the product principle tell us about \(p\text{,}\) \(q\text{,}\) and \(r\text{?}\) What do we get when we solve for \(q\text{?}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-2-basics.html#quotientprinciple">in-context</a></span>
