<p>For this edition, our goal has been to reproduce the text of Bogart's final <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> as faithfullly as possible. Based on our own classroom uses, we have notes about problems that could use revising, but we agreed the right first step would be to have source files that matched what Bogart left. We have, however, corrected obvious errors along the way, which included moving the Supplementary Chapter Problems in <a href="ch3-distribution.html" alt="Chapter 3 Distribution Problems" title="Chapter 3 Distribution Problems">Chapter 3</a> from the level of a subsection to the level of a section for consistency with the other chapters. Footnotes may be numbered differently, as in this edition, a footnote in the body of a problem is rendered with the problem and numbered in a different sequence. The hints that previously were accessed by links from the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> to a Dartmouth webpage have also been included in the backmatter of the print edition as <a href="app-hints.html" alt="Appendix D Hints to Selected Problems" title="Appendix D Hints to Selected Problems">Appendix D</a>. Links to open hints in place are available in the HTML version, while in the print and PDF edition, the existence of a hint is indicated by “(h)” at the end of the problem (or part of a problem). David Farmer provided invaluable assistance by automating the initial conversion of <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> files to PreTeXt and extracting the text of the hints from the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> files. We then worked in parallel to compare the official <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> to what we were able to produce from the source until they matched. Since this process could not be truly automated, we suspect there will be some places where Bogart's <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> and this edition do not match. We welcome reports of these through issues and pull requests on the Github site for the book <a class="external-url" href="https://github.com/OpenDiscreteMath/ibl-combinatorics/" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://github.com/OpenDiscreteMath/ibl-combinatorics/</tt></a>. Going forward, we would like to see community-driven updates to further develop the text, either by improving existing problems, adding new problems on existing topics, or adding new topics suitable for a course based on this text. One area of development may be to include SageMath to the text, since PreTeXt includles a number of nice features for doing this and some of the material may benefit from the addition of a computer algebra system to allow more interesting calculations than would be feasible by hand.</p>
