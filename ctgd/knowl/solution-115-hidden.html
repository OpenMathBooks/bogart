<body><div class="solution"><p>By the generalized pigeonhole principle, person 1 either knows at least three people or doesn't know at least three people. Suppose person 1 knows three people. Then either two of these people know each other, giving us, with person 1, three mutual acquaintances, or no two of these people know each other, giving us three mutual strangers. On the other hand if there are three people person 1 does not know, then either two of these people don't know each other, giving us, with person 1, three mutual strangers, or all three of these people know each other, giving us three mutual acquaintances.</p></div></body>
