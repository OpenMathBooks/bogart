<p>Notice that there is a simple test for whether a digraph whose vertices represent the elements of the sets \(S\) and \(T\) is the digraph of a function from \(S\) to \(T\text{.}\) There must be one and only one arrow leaving each vertex of the digraph representing an element of \(S\text{.}\) The fact that there is one arrow means that \(f(x)\) is defined for each \(x\) in \(S\text{.}\) The fact that there is only one arrow means that each \(x\) in \(S\) is related to exactly one element of \(T\text{.}\) (Note that these remarks hold as well if we have a function from \(S\) to \(S\) and draw only one set of vertices representing the elements of \(S\text{.}\)) For further discussion of functions and digraphs see <a href="relationsandfunctions.html#functionrelation" class="xref" title="Subsection A.1.1: The relation of a function">Sections A.1.1</a> and <a href="relationsandfunctions.html#relationdigraph" class="xref" title="Subsection A.1.2: Directed graphs">Subsection A.1.2</a> of {<a href="Relations.html" class="xref" title="Appendix A: Relations">Appendix A</a>}.</p>
