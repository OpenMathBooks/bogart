<body><div class="solution"><p>Suppose that our \(n\)-element set is \(N = \{a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_n\}\text{.}\) Then a subset of \(N\) either contains \(a_n\) or it doesn't. In our discussion of the Pascal recurrence, we showed that the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \(N\) that contain \(a_n\) is the same as the number of \((k - 1)\)-element subsets of \(N - \{a_n\}\text{.}\) The bijection we used to prove this consists of taking \(a_n\) away from a set containing \(a_n\text{.}\) Thus the number of subsets of \(N\) containing \(a_n\) is the same as the number of subsets of the \((n - 1)\)-element set \(N - \{a_n\}\text{.}\) But the subsets of \(N\) not containing \(a_n\) are exactly the same as the subsets of \(N - \{a_n\}\text{.}\) Thus we can partition the subsets of \(N\) into two blocks, each of which has size equal to the number of subsets of \(N - \{a_n\}\text{.}\) Therefore, by the sum principle, the number of subsets of \(N\) is twice the number of subsets of \(N - \{a_n\}\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
