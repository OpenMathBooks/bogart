<p>An <b class="terminology">ordered pair</b> \((a,b)\) consists of two things we call \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) We say \(a\) is the first member of the pair and \(b\) is the second member of the pair. If \(M\) is an \(m\) element set and \(N\) is an \(n\)-element set, how many ordered pairs are there whose first member is in \(M\) and whose second member is in \(N\text{?}\) Does this problem have anything to do with any of the previous problems?</p>
