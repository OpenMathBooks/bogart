<p>Here we need to consider the action of \(D_{15}\) on lists (functions from \([15]\) to \(\{R,B,G\}\)) with five \(R\)s, five \(B\)s, and five \(G\)s. The identity will fix \(\binom{15}{5,5,5}\) lists. A rotation through 3,6,9,or 12 places will fix any function that has the same value in places 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13, the same value in places 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14, and the same value in places 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. There are \(3!\) such lists. There is no other rotation that fixes any lists. Each flip is around an axis that goes from bead to the space between two opposite beads. If it fixed a list, the seven colors to the left of the axis would have to equal the seven colors to the right of the axis. Thus the number of beads of each color on the left and right sides would have to be equal. So except for the color of the bead the axis goes through, we would have to have an even number of beads of each color for a flip to fix a list of beads. Thus no flip fixes any functions. Therefore by the CFB theorem we have</p>
