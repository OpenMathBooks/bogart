<body><span class="solution"><p>\(\{\iota,(1\ 2\ 3),(1\ 3\ 2)\text{.}\) This is the only three-element subgroup because the other elements of \(S_3\) are two cycles, so one of them forms a two-element subgroup with \(\iota\text{,}\) and two of them together with \(\iota\) are not a subgroup. Since a subgroup acts on \(S_3\) by composition, any subgroup must have 1, 2, 3, or 6 elements, because \(S_3\) is a union of orbits of that group and the orbits all have the same size.</p></span></body>
