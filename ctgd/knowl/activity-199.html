<div class="introduction"><p>Recall that a tree is determined by its edge set. Suppose you have a tree on \(n\) vertices, say with vertex set \([n]\text{.}\) We can use \(x_i\) as the picture of vertex \(i\) and \(x_ix_j\) as the picture of the edge \(x_ix_j\text{.}\) Then one possible picture of the tree \(T\) is the product \(P(T) = \prod_{\{i,j\}:i\text{ and }j\text{ are adjacent }}x_ix_j\text{.}\)</p></div>

<p>Explain why the picture of a tree is also \(\prod_{i=1}^nx_i^{\deg(i)}\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>Write down the picture enumerators for trees on two, three, and four vertices. Factor them as completely as possible.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>Explain why \(x_1x_2\cdots x_n\) is a factor of the picture of a tree on \(n\) vertices.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
<p>Write down the picture of a tree on five vertices with one vertex of degree four, say vertex \(i\text{.}\) If a tree on five vertices has a vertex of degree three, what are the possible degrees of the other vertices. What can you say about the picture of a tree with a vertex of degree three? If a tree on five vertices has no vertices of degree three or four, how many vertices of degree two does it have? What can you say about its picture? Write down the picture enumerator for trees on five vertices.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h6>
<p>Find a (relatively) simple polynomial expression for the picture enumerator  \(\sum_{T \colon T\text{ is a tree on }[n]} P (T)\text{.}\) Prove it is correct.</p>

<p>The enumerator for trees by degree sequence is the sum over all trees of \(x^{d_1}x^{d_2} \cdots x^{d_n}\text{,}\) where \(d_i\) is the degree of vertex \(i\text{.}\) What is the enumerator by degree sequence for trees on the vertex set \([n]\text{?}\)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_genfns-idea.html#activity-199">in-context</a></span>
