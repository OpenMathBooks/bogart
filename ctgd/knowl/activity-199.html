<p id="p-1116">Write down the picture of a tree on five vertices with one vertex of degree four, say vertex \(i\text{.}\) If a tree on five vertices has a vertex of degree three, what are the possible degrees of the other vertices. What can you say about the picture of a tree with a vertex of degree three? If a tree on five vertices has no vertices of degree three or four, how many vertices of degree two does it have? What can you say about its picture? Write down the picture enumerator for trees on five vertices.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-137"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>

Factor \(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5\) out of the picture and look at what is left.  How is it related to your vertices of degree one? Now remove the vertices of degree 1 from the tree and write down the picture of the tree that remains.  What is special about the vertices of degree 1 of that tree.
