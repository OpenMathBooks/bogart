<p>We defined the rotation group \(R_4\) and the dihedral group \(D_4\) as groups of permutations of the vertices of a square. These permutations represent rigid motions of the square in the plane and in three dimensional space respectively. The square has geometric features of interest other than its vertices; for example its diagonals, or its edges. Any geometric motion of the square that returns it to its original position takes each diagonal to a possibly different diagonal, and takes each edge to a possibly different edge. In <a knowl="./knowl/rotate-square.html" knowl-id="xref-rotate-square" alt="Figure 6.2.1 " title="Figure 6.2.1 ">Figure 6.2.1</a> we show the results on the sides and diagonals of the rotations of a square. The rotation group permutes the sides of the square and permutes the diagonals of the square as it rotates the square. Thus, we say the rotation group “acts” on the sides and diagonals of the square.</p>
