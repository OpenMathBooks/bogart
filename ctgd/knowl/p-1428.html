<p>Each person attending a party has been asked to bring a prize. The person planning the party has arranged to give out exactly as many prizes as there are guests, but any person may win any number of prizes. If there are \(n\) guests, in how many ways may the prizes be given out so that nobody gets the prize that he or she brought?</p>
