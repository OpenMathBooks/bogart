<p>Start with two questions that can apply to any inclusion-exclusion problem. Do you think you would be better off trying to compute the size of a union of sets or the size of a complement of a union of sets? What kinds of sets (that are conceivably of use to you) is it easy to compute the size of? (The second question can be interpreted in different ways, and for each way of interpreting it, the answer may help you see something you can use in solving the problem.)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_inclexcl-apps.html#hint-217">in-context</a></span>
