<p><a knowl="./knowl/hatcheck.html" knowl-id="xref-hatcheck" alt="Problem 231 " title="Problem 231 ">Problem 231</a> is “classically” called the <b class="terminology">hatcheck problem</b>; the name comes from substituting hats for backpacks. If is also sometimes called the <b class="terminology">derangement problem</b>. A <b class="terminology">derangement</b> of an \(n\)-element set is a permutation of that set (thought of as a bijection) that maps no element of the set to itself. One can think of a way of handing back the backpacks as a permutation \(f\) of the students: \(f(i)\) is the owner of the backpack that student \(i\) receives. Then a derangement is a way to pass back the backpacks so that no student gets his or her own.</p>
