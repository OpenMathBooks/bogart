<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">Problem 345</a> there is a subtle change. In the language we adopted for seating people around a round table, if we choose the flavors V, C, and S, and arrange them in the dish with C to the right of V and S to the right of C, then the scoops are in different relative positions than if we arrange them instead with S to the right of V and C to the right of S. Thus the order in which the scoops go into the dish is somewhat important—somewhat, because putting in V first, then C to its right and S to its right is the same as putting in S first, then V to its right and C to its right. In this case, each list of three flavors is equivalent to only three lists, including itself, and so if there are \(n\) equivalence classes, we have \(3n=24\text{,}\) so there are \(24/3=8\) equivalence classes.</p>
