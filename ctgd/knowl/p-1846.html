<p><a knowl="./knowl/functionsasorderedpairs.html" title="Problem 328">Problem 328</a> points out how two functions which appear to be different are actually the same on some domain of interest to us. Most of the time when we are thinking about functions it is fine to think of a function casually as a relationship between two sets. In <a knowl="./knowl/functionsasorderedpairs.html" title="Problem 328">Problem 328</a> the set of ordered pairs you wrote down for each function is called the <dfn class="terminology">relation</dfn> of the function. When we want to distinguish between the casual and the careful in talking about relationships, our casual term will be “relationship” and our careful term will be “relation.” So <em class="emphasis">relation</em> is a technical word in mathematics, and as such it has a technical definition. A <dfn class="terminology">relation</dfn> from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a set of ordered pairs whose first elements are in \(S\) and whose second elements are in \(T\text{.}\) Another way to say this is that a <dfn class="terminology">relation</dfn> from \(S\) to \(T\) is a subset of \(S\times T\text{.}\)</p>
