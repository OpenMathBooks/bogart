<p>While the formula you proved in <a knowl="./knowl/nchoosek.html" title="Problem 35">Problems 35</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosekfinal.html" title="Part 39.d">39.d</a> is very useful, it doesn't give us a sense of how big the binomial coefficients are. We can get a very rough idea, for example, of the size of \(\binom{2n}{n}\) by recognizing that we can write \((2n)^{\underline{n}}/n!\) as \(\frac{2n}{n}\cdot
\frac{2n-1}{n-1}\cdots \frac{n+1}{1}\text{,}\) and each quotient is at least \(2\text{,}\) so the product is at least \(2^n\text{.}\) If this were an accurate estimate, it would mean the fraction of \(n\)-element subsets of a \(2n\)-element set would be about         \(2^n/2^{2n}=1/2^n\text{,}\) which becomes very small as \(n\) becomes large. However it is pretty clear the approximation will not be a very good one, because some of the terms in that product are much larger than 2. In fact, if \(\binom{2n}{k}\) were the same for every \(k\text{,}\) then each would be the fraction \(\frac{1}{2n+1}\) of \(2^{2n}\text{.}\) This is much larger than the fraction \(\frac{1}{2^n}\text{.}\) But our intuition suggets that \(\binom{2n}{n}\) is much larger than \(\binom{2n}{1}\) and is likely larger than \(\binom{2n}{n-1}\) so we can be sure our approximation is a bad one. For estimates like this, James Stirling developed a formula to approximate \(n!\) when \(n\) is large, namely \(n!\) is about \(\left(\sqrt{2\pi
n}\right){n^n/ e^n}\text{.}\) In fact the ratio of \(n!\) to this expression approaches 1 as \(n\) becomes infinite.<a knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> We write this as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
n!\sim \sqrt{2\pi
n}\frac{n^n}{e^n}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We read this notation as \(n!\) is asymptotic to \(\sqrt{2\pi n}\frac{n^n}{e^n}\text{.}\) Use Stirling's formula to show that the fraction of subsets of size \(n\) in an \(2n\)-element set is approximately \(1/\sqrt{\pi n}\text{.}\) This is a much bigger fraction than \(\frac{1}{2^n}\text{!}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-2-basics.html#Stirling_sapproximation">in-context</a></span>
