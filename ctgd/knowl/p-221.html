<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/tab_permsof3.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_permsof3" alt="Table 1.2.8 " title="Table 1.2.8 ">TableÂ 1.2.8</a> we list all three-element permutations of the \(5\)-element set \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{.}\) Each row consists of all \(3\)-element permutations of some subset of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{.}\) Because a given \(k\)-element subset can be listed as a \(k\)-element permutation in \(k!\) ways, there are \(3!=6\) permutations in each row. Because each \(3\)-element permutation appears exactly once in the table, each row is a block of a partition of the set of \(3\)-element permutations of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{.}\) Each block has size six. Each block consists of all \(3\)-element permutations of some three-element subset of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{.}\) Since there are ten rows, we see that there are ten \(3\)-element subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{.}\) An alternate way to see this is to observe that we partitioned the set of all \(60\) three-element permutations of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) into some number \(q\) of blocks, each of size six. Thus by the product principle, \(q\cdot 6=60\text{,}\) so \(q=10\text{.}\)</p>
