<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" knowl-id="xref-fourchoosethree" alt="Problem 344 " title="Problem 344 ">ProblemsÂ 344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" knowl-id="xref-icecreaminadish" alt="Problem 345 " title="Problem 345 ">345</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" knowl-id="xref-roundtablefour" alt="Problem 346 " title="Problem 346 ">346</a> there is another property of those relations you may have noticed from the directed graph. Whenever you had an arrow from \(L_1\) to \(L_2\) and an arrow from \(L_2\) to \(L_3\text{,}\) then there was an arrow from \(L_1\) to \(L_3\text{.}\) This is what we mean when we say a relation is <em class="terminology">transitive</em>. You also undoubtedly noticed how the directed graph divides up into clumps of mutually connected vertices. This is what equivalence relations are all about. Let's be a bit more precise in our description of what it means for a relation to be reflexive, symmetric or transitive. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>If \(R\) is a relation on a set \(X\text{,}\) we say \(R\) is <em class="terminology">reflexive</em>  if \((x,x)\in
R\) for every \(x\in X\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(R\) is a relation on a set \(X\text{,}\) we say \(R\) is <em class="terminology">symmetric</em> if \((x,y)\) is in \(R\) whenever \((y,x)\) is in \(R\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(R\) is a relation on a set \(X\text{,}\) we say \(R\) is <em class="terminology">transitive</em> if whenever \((x,y)\) is in \(R\) and \((y,z)\) is in \(R\text{,}\) then \((x,z)\) is in \(R\) as well.</p></li>
