<p>You probably see that we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage as long as \(n\) is at least 20. However you didn't try to make 26 cents in postage by working with 25 cents; rather you saw that you could get 20 cents and then add six cents to that to get 26 cents. Thus if we want to prove by induction that we are right that if \(n\ge 20\text{,}\) then we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage, we are going to have to use the strong version of the principle of mathematical induction.</p>
