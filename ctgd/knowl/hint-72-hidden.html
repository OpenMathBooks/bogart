<body><span class="solution"><p>One expects to need double induction again here. But only because of the location of the problem and because the sum looks like double induction. And those reasons aren't enough to mean you have to use double induction. If you had this result in hand already, then you could us it with double induction to give a second proof that Ramsey Numbers exist.</p></span></body>
