<body><div class="solution"><p>You've probably already seen that, with small values of \(n\text{,}\) sometimes \(n^2\) and sometimes \(2^n\) is bigger. But if you keep experimenting one of the functions  seems to get bigger and stay bigger than the other. The number \(n=b\) where this change occurs is a good choice for a base case. So as not to spoil the problem for you, we won't say here what this value of \(b\) is. However you    shouldn't be surprised later in the proof if you need to use the assumption that \(n /gt b\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
