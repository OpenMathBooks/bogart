<p>This PreTeXt edition of <span class="booktitle">Combinatorics through Guided Discovery</span> attempts to help fulfill the Bogart family's wish to see the project grow and reach a complete state. One of us (<abbr class="initialism">MTK</abbr>) had used the official <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> to teach a combinatorics course in Winter 2015 and mentioned this fact at a workshop on open source textbooks and PreTeXt (then MathBook <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr>) organized by the American Institute of Mathematics in the spring of 2016. This caught the attention of <abbr class="initialism">KEM</abbr>, since <span class="booktitle">Combinatorics through Guided Discovery</span> had been placed on the <abbr class="initialism">AIM</abbr> list of approved open source textbooks, but there had been no success in finding someone to take on the task of updating the source to match the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr>. The three of us came together again in May 2017 at the University of Puget Sound for another workshop on open educational resources and agreed to cooperate to complete the conversion of this book to PreTeXt. The fact that <abbr class="initialism">OL</abbr> wanted to use parts of the book for his Fall 2017 class gave us the motivation required to complete the project over the summer.</p>
