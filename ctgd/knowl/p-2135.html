<p>Our next corollary uses the idea of a \(k\)-set structure. Suppose we have a species \(\F\) of structures on nonempty subsets of \(X\text{,}\) that is, a species of structures which assigns no structures to the empty set. Then we can define a new species \(\F^{(k)}\) of structures, called “\(k\)-set structures,” using nonempty subsets of \(X\text{.}\) Given a fixed positive integer \(k\text{,}\) a <dfn class="terminology">\(k\)-set structure</dfn> on a subset \(Y\) of \(X\) consists of a \(k\)-element set of nonempty disjoint subsets of \(X\) whose union is \(Y\) and an assignment of an \(\F\)-structure to each of the disjoint subsets. This is a species on the set of subsets of \(X\text{;}\) the subset used by a \(k\)-set structure is the union of the sets of the structure. To recapitulate, the set of \(k\)-set structures on a subset \(Y\) of \(X\) is the set of all possible assignments of \(\F\)-structures to \(k\) nonempty disjoint sets whose union is \(Y\text{.}\) (You can also think of the \(k\)-set structures as a family of structures defined on blocks of partitions of subsets of \(X\) into \(k\) blocks.)</p>
