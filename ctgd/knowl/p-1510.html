<p>Another view of the dihedral group of the square is that it is the group of all distance preserving functions, also called <dfn class="terminology">isometries</dfn>,  from a square to itself.  Notice that an isometry must be a bijection.  Any rigid motion of the square preserves the distances between all points of the square.  However, it is conceivable that there might be some isometries that do not arise from rigid motions.  (We will see some later on in the case of a cube.)  Show that there are exactly eight isometires (distance preserving functions) from a square to itself.</p>
