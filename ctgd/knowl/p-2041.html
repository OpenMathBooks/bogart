<p>However with our previous definition of generating functions, this equation would not give a generating function for the Stirling numbers of the second kind, because \(S(n,i)\) is not the coefficient of \(x^i\text{.}\) If we were willing to consider the falling factorial powers \(x^{\underline{i}}\) as indicator polynomials, then we could say that \(x^n\) is the generating function for the numbers \(S(n,i)\) relative to these indicator polynomials. This suggests that perhaps different sorts of indicator polynomials go naturally with different sequences of numbers.</p>
