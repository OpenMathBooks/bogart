<p>Furthermore, \(a_k=a_{mn-k}\text{,}\) because the complement in an \(m\) by \(n\) rectangle of a partition of \(k\) is a partition of \(mn-k\text{,}\) and complementation in an \(m\) by \(n\) rectangle is a bijection between partitions of \(k\) that fit into the rectangle and partitions of \(mn-k\) that fit into the rectangle. Thus \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\) is a polynomial of degree \(mn\) in which the coefficient of \(q_k\) equals the coefficient of \(q^{mn-k}\text{.}\) For this reason we can compute the limit as \(q\) approaches \(-1\) simply by substituting \(-1\) for \(q\) in the polynomial; the only trouble being that the formula we know for \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\) is quotient of polynomials that has zero in both the numerator and denominator when we substitute in \(q=-1\text{.}\) Nonetheless, when we substitute \(-1\) for \(q\) we get the alternating sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i\text{.}\)  Thus if \(a_i\) and \(a_{mn-i}\) have opposite sign, they will cancel out. If \(mn\) is even, \(i\) is even exactly when \(mn-i\) is even, and so \(a_i\) and \(a_{mn-i}\) have the same sign. However when \(mn\) is odd, \(a_i\) and \(a_{mn-i}\) have opposite signs in the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i\text{,}\) and so the sum is zero.  Thus the polynomial \(\qchoose{m+n}{n}\) is zero at \(q=-1\) whenever \(mn\) is odd.</p>
