<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/picture-enumerator-hexagon.html" title="Part 310.c">ProblemÂ c</a> we saw a picture enumerator for pictures of orbits of the action of a group on colorings. As above, we can ask how many orbits of the colorings have any given picture. We can think of a multivariable generating function in which the letters we use to picture individual colors are the variables, and the coefficient of a picture is the number of orbits with that picture. Such a generating function is an answer to our natural question, and so it is this sort of generating function we will seek. Since the CFB theorem was our primary tool for saying how many orbits we have, it makes sense to think about whether the CFB theorem has an analog in terms of pictures of orbits.</p>
