<p>Our combinatorial interpretation of EGFs will involve assuming that the coefficient of \(\frac{x^i}{i!}\) counts the number of structures on a particular set of of size \(i\) in a species of structures on subsets of a set \(X\text{.}\)  Thus in order to give an interpretation of the product of two EGFs we need to be able to think of ordered pairs of structures on disjoint sets or \(k\)-tuples of structures on disjoint sets as structures themselves. Thus given a structure on a set \(S\) and another structure on a disjoint set \(T\text{,}\) we define the ordered pair of structures (which is a mathematical construction!) to be a structure on the set \(S\cup T\text{.}\) We call this a <dfn class="terminology">pair structure</dfn>   on \(S\cup T\text{.}\) We can get many structures on a set \(S\cup T\) in this way, because \(S\cup T\) can be divided into many other pairs of disjoint sets. In particular, the set of pair structures whose first structure comes from \(\F\) and whose second element comes from \(\mathcal{G}\) is denoted by \(\F\cdot \mathcal{G}\text{.}\)</p>
