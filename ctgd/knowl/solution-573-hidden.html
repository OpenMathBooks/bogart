<body><span class="solution"><p>From the point of view of digraphs, if \(f\) is a bijection, we can get the digraph of an inverse by reversing all the arrows in the digraph of \(f\text{.}\) If you prefer to use the definitions directly, suppose \(f\) is a bijection. For each \(y\) in \(T\text{,}\) let \(g(y)\) be the \(x\) such that \(f(x) = y\text{.}\) (There must be such an \(x\) because \(f\) is a bijection.) Then \(g(f(x)) = x\) by definition. To compute \(f(g(y))\text{,}\) we have to take \(f(x)\text{,}\) where \(x\) is the unique element of \(S\) such that \(f(x) = y\text{.}\) Thus \(f(g(y)) = y\text{.}\) Therefore \(g\) is an inverse to \(f\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
