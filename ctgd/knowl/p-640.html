<p>Many of the applications of trees arise from trying to find an efficient way to connect all the vertices of a graph. For example, in a telephone network, at any given time we have a certain number of wires (or microwave channels, or cellular channels) available for use. These wires or channels go from a specific place to a specific place. Thus the wires or channels may be thought of as edges of a graph and the places the wires connect may be thought of as vertices of that graph. A tree whose edges are some of the edges of a graph \(G\) and whose vertices are all of the vertices of the graph \(G\) is called a <em class="terminology">spanning tree</em> of \(G\text{.}\) A spanning tree for a telephone network will give us a way to route calls between any two vertices in the network. In <a knowl="./knowl/spanningtrees.html" knowl-id="xref-spanningtrees" alt="Figure 2.3.3 " title="Figure 2.3.3 ">FigureÂ 2.3.3</a> we show a graph and all its spanning trees.</p>
