<p>We let \(\F\) be the family of permutations of finite sets of positive integers whose cycle decomposition consists of exactly one two-cycle. Since the number of two-cycle stryctures on a two-element set is one and the number on a set of any other size is 0, we have a species of structures on the finite subsets of the positive integers. We saw in <a knowl="./knowl/exp_two-cycle_.html" title="Problem 411">Problem 411</a> that the EGF for permutations whose cycle decomposition consists of exactly one two-cycle is \(x^2/2\text{.}\) By the <a knowl="./knowl/exponentialformulathm.html" title="Theorem C.5.1">exponential formula</a>, the EGF for finite sets of disjoint two-cycles is \(\exp(x^2/2)\text{.}\) But a sets of disjoint two-cycles correspond bijectively with permutations of subsets of the positive integers which are products of disjoint two-cycles (only), and this confirms the result of <a knowl="./knowl/exponentialtennisparings.html" title="Problem 378">Problem 378</a>.</p>
