<p>From the fifth factor on, there is no way to choose a \(q^i\) that has \(i\) nonzero and less than five from the factor. Thus we choose a 1 from each of these factors. We can choose a \(q^4\) from the fourth factor and 1 from the rest, a \(q^3\) from the third factor, a \(q\) from the first and a 1 from the rest, a \(q^2\) from the second factor, a \(q^2\) from the first and a 1 from the rest, or we can choose a \(q^4\) from the first factor and a 1 from the rest. Therefore the coefficient of \(q^4\) is five.</p>
