<p>In <a href="s1-3-apps.html#Ramseysection" class="xref" title="Subsection 1.3.4: Ramsey Numbers">SectionÂ 1.3.4</a> we gave two different descriptions of the Ramsey number \(R(m,n)\text{.}\) However if you look carefully, you will see that we never showed that Ramsey numbers actually exist; we merely described what they were and showed that \(R(3,3)\) and \(R(3,4)\) exist by computing them directly. As long as we can show that there is some number \(R\) such that when there are \(R\) people together, there are either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, this shows that the Ramsey Number \(R(m,n)\) exists, because it is the smallest such \(R\text{.}\) Mathematical induction allows us to show that one such \(R\) is \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\text{.}\) The question is, what should we induct on, \(m\) or \(n\text{?}\) In other words, do we use the fact that with \(\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}\) people in a room there are at least \(m-1\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, or do we use the fact that with at least \(\binom{m+n-3}{n-2}\) people in a room there are at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n-1\) mutual strangers? It turns out that we use both. Thus we want to be able to simultaneously induct on \(m\) and \(n\text{.}\) One way to do that is to use yet another variation on the principle of mathematical induction, the <dfn class="terminology">Principle of Double Mathematical Induction</dfn>. This principle (which can be derived from one of our earlier ones) states that</p>
