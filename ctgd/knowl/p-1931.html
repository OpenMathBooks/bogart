<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems 344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">345</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" title="Problem 346">346</a> (as well as <a knowl="./knowl/twelvechoosethree.html" title="Problem 34">Problems 34</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Problem 38">38</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/formulanchoosek.html" title="Problem 39">39</a>) we can begin with a set of lists, and say when two lists are equivalent as representations of the objects we are trying to count. In particular, in <a knowl="./knowl/fourchoosethree.html" title="Problem 344">Problems 344</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminadish.html" title="Problem 345">345</a>, and <a knowl="./knowl/roundtablefour.html" title="Problem 346">346</a> you drew the directed graph for this relation of equivalence. Technically, you should have had an arrow from each vertex (list) to itself. This is what we mean when we say a relation is <dfn class="terminology">reflexive</dfn>. Whenever you had an arrow from one vertex to a second, you had an arrow back to the first. This is what we mean when we say a relation is <dfn class="terminology">symmetric</dfn>.</p>
