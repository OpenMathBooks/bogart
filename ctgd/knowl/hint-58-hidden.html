<body><span class="solution"><p>What usually makes it hard for students to start this problem is the fact that we just defined what \(R(4, 4)\) is, and not what it means for a number <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> to be \(R(4, 4)\text{.}\) So to get started, try to write down what it means to say \(R(4, 4)\) is not 8. You will see that there are two things that can keep \(R(4, 4)\) from being 8. You need to figure out which one happens and explain why. One such explanation could involve the graph \(K_8\) .</p></span></body>
