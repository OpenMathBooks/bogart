<p>We prove by induction on \(n\) that there is one and only one value \(s_n\) that satisfies both \(s_n=2s_{n-1}\) for \(n&gt;0\) and \(s_0=1\text{.}\) First, there is clearly one and only one value \(s_0\) that satisfies \(s_0=1\text{.}\) Now assume that \(k&gt;0\) and there is one and only one value \(s_{k-1}\) that satisfies the two equations. Then \(s_k=2s_{k-1}\) is the one and only one value that satisfies the two equations. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, for all nonnegative integers \(n\) there is one and only one value \(s_n\) that satisfies the equations \(s_0=1\) and \(s_k=2s_{k-1}\) for all \(k&gt;0\text{.}\) (Note that since we were making a statement about \(s_n\) for all nonnegative integers \(n\) it was not appropriate to use \(n\) as the dummy variable in the recursive equation \(s_k=2s_{k-1}\text{.}\))</p>
