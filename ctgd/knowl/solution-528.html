<p>We effectively answered this question in our solution to <a knowl="./knowl/polya2.html" title="Problem 315">Problem 315</a>. In particular, there are three rotations of 180 degrees through the centers of opposite faces. The other kinds of group elements are as follows. </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>the 90 and 270 degree rotations around an axis through two faces, of which we have six.  Their cycle structure consists of a four-cycle and two one-cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>the 120 and 240 degree rotations around an axis connecting two diagonally opposite vertices.  Their cycle structure consists of two three-cycles.  We have eight of these.</p></li>
<li><p>the 180 degree rotations around an axis connecting two opposite edges; their cycle structure consists of three two-cycles.  We have six of these.</p></li>
<li><p>the identity, whose cycle structure is six one-cycles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> As we said in the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/polya3_5.html" title="Problem 318">Problem 318</a> ``The cycle structure determines the factored enumerator; a cycle of size \(i\) gives a factor of \((R^i+B^i)\text{.}\) That is because a coloring fixed by a group element has to be constant on the cycles of that group element. If a cycle has size \(i\text{,}\) it contributes a summand of \(P^i\) to the picture enumerator for colorings of that cycle for each picture \(P\) of a possible value of the function. <a knowl="./knowl/PictureEnumeratorforFunctions.html" title="Problem 313">Problem 313</a> tells us to multiply these individual picture enumerators together.''</p>
