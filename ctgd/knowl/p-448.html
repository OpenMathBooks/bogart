<p>When we studied the Pascal Equation and subsets in <a href="what-is.html" class="xref" title="Chapter 1: What is Combinatorics?">ChapterÂ 1</a>, it may have appeared that there is no connection between the Pascal relation \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} +\binom{n-1}{k}\) and the formula \(\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\text{.}\) Of course you probably realize you can prove the Pascal relation by substituting the values the formula gives you into the right-hand side of the equation and simplifying to give you the left hand side. In fact, from the Pascal Relation and the facts that \(\binom{n}{0}=1\) and \(\binom{n}{n}=1\text{,}\) you can actually prove the formula for \(\binom{n}{k}\) by induction on \(n\text{.}\) Do so.</p>
