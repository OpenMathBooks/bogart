<p>Using \(d\) for down and \(u\) for up, we could have \(uudduuddudud\) as our Catalan path. Suppose that \(i = 5\text{.}\) The fifth upstep is the \(u\) in position 9. Thus \(F = uudduudd\text{,}\) \(U = u\text{,}\) and \(B = dud\text{.}\) Now \(BU F\) is \(duduuudduudd\text{.}\) This is a Dyck path that begins by going below the \(x\)-axis. The \(d\)'s in positions 1 and 3 take the path to the \(y\)-coordinate \(-1\text{.}\) Then the \(y\) coordinate climbs to 2, goes back to 0, up to 2 again, and finally down to 0. So the absolute minimum is \(-1\text{,}\) and it occurs in the first and third position. There are five \(u\)'s after the third positon. So this Dyck path is in the block \(B_5\) of our partition. Now comes the crucial question. Why were there five u's after that last absolute minimum in position 3? Try with the same path and \(i = 3\text{.}\) Figure out why there are three u's after the last absolute minimum in the resulting path. All this discussion should explain why when \(i = 5\text{,}\) the set of all Catalan paths is mapped into the set \(B_5\text{.}\) Keeping \(i = 5\) for a while, try to see why this correspondence between Catalan paths and \(B_5\) is a bijection. Then, if you need to, do the same thing with \(i = 3\text{.}\) This should give you enough insight to do the general case.</p>
