<article class="introduction" id="introduction-13"><p id="p-188">As we noted in <a knowl="./knowl/Pascal.html" knowl-id="xref-Pascal" alt="Problem 29 " title="Problem 29 ">Problem 29</a>, the first question in <a knowl="./knowl/icecreaminpints.html" knowl-id="xref-icecreaminpints" alt="Problem 8 " title="Problem 8 ">Problem 8</a> asked us for the number of three-element subsets of a twelve-element set. We were able to use the Pascal Equation to get a numerical answer to that question. Had we had twenty or thirty flavors of ice cream to choose from, using the Pascal Equation to get our answer would have entailed a good bit more work. We have seen how the general product principle gives us an answer to <a knowl="./knowl/tripledeckercone.html" knowl-id="xref-tripledeckercone" alt="Problem 6 " title="Problem 6 ">Problem 6</a>. Thus we might think that the number of ways to choose a three element set from 12 elements is the number of ways to choose the first element times the number of ways to choose the second element times the number of ways to choose the third element, which is \(12\cdot11\cdot10=1320\text{.}\) However, our result in <a knowl="./knowl/Pascal.html" knowl-id="xref-Pascal" alt="Problem 29 " title="Problem 29 ">Problem 29</a> shows that this is wrong.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="task-35"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p id="p-189">What is it that is different between the number of ways to stack ice cream in a triple decker cone with three different flavors of ice cream and the number of ways to simply choose three different flavors of ice cream?</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="twelvechoosethreethree"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p id="p-191">In particular, how many different triple decker cones use the same three flavors?  (Of course any three distinct flavors could substitute for vanilla, chocolate and strawberry without changing the answer.)</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="twelvechoosethreefinal"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p id="p-193">Using your answer from <a knowl="./knowl/twelvechoosethreethree.html" knowl-id="xref-twelvechoosethreethree" alt="Part 34.b " title="Part 34.b ">part b</a>, compute the number of ways to choose three different flavors of ice cream (out of twelve flavors) from the number of ways to choose a triple decker cone with three different flavors (out of twelve  flavors).</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s1-2-basics.html#twelvechoosethree">in-context</a></span>
