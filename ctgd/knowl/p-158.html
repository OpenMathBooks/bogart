<p>It is less common to see Pascal's triangle as a right triangle, but it actually makes your formula easier to interpret. In Pascal's Right Triangle, the element in row \(n\) and column \(k\) (with the convention that the first row is row zero and the first column is column zero) is \(\binom{n}{k}\text{.}\) In this case your formula says each entry in a row is the sum of the one above and the one above and to the left, except for the leftmost and rightmost entries of a row, for which that doesn't make sense. Since the leftmost entry is \(\binom{n}{0}\) and the rightmost entry is \(\binom{n}{n}\text{,}\) these entries are both one (to see why, ask yourself how many \(0\)-element subsets and how many \(n\)-element subsets an \(n\)-element set has), and your formula then tells how to fill in the rest of the table.</p>
