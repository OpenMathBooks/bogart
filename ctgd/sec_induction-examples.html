<p> then we can conclude the statement is true for all integers \(n\ge
b\text{.}\)</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p-439">As an example, let us give yet another proof that a set with \(n\) elements has \(2^n\) subsets. This proof uses essentially the same bijections we used in proving the Pascal Equation. The statement we wish to prove is the statement that ‚ÄúA set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-9"><p id="p-440">Our statement is true when \(n=0\text{,}\) because a set of size 0 is the empty set and the empty set has \(1=2^0\) subsets. (This step of our proof is called a <dfn class="terminology">base step</dfn>.) Now suppose that \(k&gt;0\) and every set with \(k-1\) elements has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets.  Suppose \(S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_k\}\) is a set with \(k\) elements. We partition the subsets of \(S\) into two blocks.  Block \(B_1\) consists of the subsets that do not contain \(a_n\) and block \(B_2\) consists of the subsets that do contain \(a_n\text{.}\)  Each set in \(B_1\) is a subset of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\text{,}\) and each subset of \(\{a_1,a_2, \ldots
a_{k-1}\}\) is in \(B_1\text{.}\)  Thus \(B_1\) is the set of all subsets of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\text{.}\)  Therefore by our assumption in the first sentence of this paragraph, the size of \(B_1\) is \(2^{k-1}\text{.}\)  Consider the function from \(B_2\) to \(B_1\) which takes a subset of \(S\) including \(a_k\) and removes \(a_k\) from it.  This function is defined on \(B_2\text{,}\) because every set in \(B_2\) contains \(a_k\text{.}\)  This function is onto, because if \(T\) is a set in \(B_1\text{,}\) then \(T\cup \{a_k\}\) is a set in \(B_2\) which the function sends to \(T\text{.}\)  This function is one-to-one because if \(V\) and \(W\) are two different sets in \(B_2\text{,}\) then removing \(a_k\) from them gives two different sets in \(B_1\text{.}\)  Thus we have a bijection between \(B_1\) and \(B_2\text{,}\) so \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) have the same size.  Therefore by the sum principle the size of \(B_1\cup B_2\) is \(2^{k-1} +2^{k-1}=2^k\text{.}\)  Therefore \(S\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  This shows that if a set of size \(k-1\) has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets, then a set of size \(k\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, a set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets for every nonnegative integer \(n\text{.}\)</p></blockquote>
<p id="p-441">The first sentence of the last paragraph is called the <dfn class="terminology">inductive hypothesis</dfn>. In an inductive proof we always make an inductive hypothesis as part of proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\text{.}\) The last paragraph itself is called the <dfn class="terminology">inductive step</dfn> of our proof. In an inductive step we derive the statement for \(n=k\) from the statement for \(n=k-1\text{,}\) thus proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\text{.}\) The last sentence in the last paragraph is called the <dfn class="terminology">inductive conclusion</dfn>. All inductive proofs should have a base step, an inductive hypothesis, an inductive step, and an inductive conclusion.</p>
<p id="p-442">There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our base step was the case \(n=0\text{,}\) or in other words, we had \(b=0\text{.}\) However, in other proofs, \(b\) could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement for \(n=k\) required that \(k\) be at least 1, so that there would be an element \(a_k\) we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However, condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires that we be able to prove the implication for \(k&gt;0\text{,}\) so we were allowed to assume \(k&gt;0\text{.}\)</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-1"><h4 class="heading hide-type">

</h4>
<a href="sec_induction-examples.html#subsubsection-1" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-443">One way of looking at the principle of mathematical induction is that it tells us that if we know the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù case of a theorem and we can derive each other case of the theorem from a smaller case, then the theorem is true in all cases. However the particular way in which we stated the theorem is rather restrictive in that it requires us to derive each case from the immediately preceding case. This restriction is not necessary, and removing it leads us to a more general statement of the principal of mathematical induction which people often call the <dfn class="terminology">strong principle of mathematical induction</dfn>. It states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-10">
<p id="p-444">In order to prove a statement about an integer \(n\) if we can </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-10"><p id="p-445">prove our statement when \(n=b\) and</p></li>

<p id="p-448">When we studied the Pascal Equation and subsets in <a href="what-is.html" class="xref" title="Chapter 1: What is Combinatorics?">Chapter¬†1</a>, it may have appeared that there is no connection between the Pascal relation \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} +\binom{n-1}{k}\) and the formula \(\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\text{.}\) Of course you probably realize you can prove the Pascal relation by substituting the values the formula gives you into the right-hand side of the equation and simplifying to give you the left hand side. In fact, from the Pascal Relation and the facts that \(\binom{n}{0}=1\) and \(\binom{n}{n}=1\text{,}\) you can actually prove the formula for \(\binom{n}{k}\) by induction on \(n\text{.}\) Do so.</p>

As long as we can show that there is some number \(R\) such that when there are \(R\) people together, there are either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, this shows that the Ramsey Number \(R(m,n)\) exists, because it is the smallest such \(R\text{.}\) Mathematical induction allows us to show that one such \(R\) is \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\text{.}\) The question is, what should we induct on, \(m\) or \(n\text{?}\) In other words, do we use the fact that with \(\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}\) people in a room there are at least \(m-1\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, or do we use the fact that with at least \(\binom{m+n-3}{n-2}\) people in a room there are at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n-1\) mutual strangers? It turns out that we use both. Thus we want to be able to simultaneously induct on \(m\) and \(n\text{.}\) One way to do that is to use yet another variation on the principle of mathematical induction, the <dfn class="terminology">Principle of Double Mathematical Induction</dfn>. This principle (which can be derived from one of our earlier ones) states that</p>
