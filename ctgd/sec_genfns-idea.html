<a href="sec_genfns-idea.html#subsection-40" class="permalink">¬∂</a></header><p id="p-1045">Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as</p>
\begin{equation*}
\ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
+\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
<p>Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus \(\ap\) stands for taking an apple, \(\ap\pe\) for taking an apple and a pear, and \(\ap\ap\) for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the ‚Äúexclusive or,‚Äù that is, \(\ap+\ba\) would stand for ‚ÄúI take an apple or a banana but not both.‚Äù To say ‚ÄúI take both an apple and a banana,‚Äù we would write \(\ap\ba\text{.}\) We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to</p>
\begin{equation*}
\ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
\ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
<p id="p-1046">In this notation \(\ap^3\) stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while \(\ap^2\ba\) stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\text{.}\)<a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-9" id="fn-9"><span class="footnote"><sup>‚Äâ1‚Äâ</sup></span></a><span id="hk-fn-9" class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">This approach was inspired by George P√≥lya's paper ‚ÄúPicture Writing,‚Äù in the December, 1956 issue of the <span class="booktitle">American Mathematical Monthly</span>, page 689.

<p id="p-1047">Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as</p>

At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="picturefunction"><header title="Subsection 4.1.2 Picture functions"><h3 class="heading hide-type" alt="Subsection 4.1.2 Picture functions">

<a href="sec_genfns-idea.html#picturefunction" class="permalink">¬∂</a></header><p id="p-1054">As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent<a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-10" id="fn-10"><span class="footnote"><sup>‚Äâ2‚Äâ</sup></span></a><span id="hk-fn-10" class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">We are really adapting language introduced by George P√≥lya.</span></span> some. By a <b class="terminology">picture</b> of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture \(P(s)\) to each member \(s\) of a set \(S\) will be called a <b class="terminology">picture function</b> . The <b class="terminology">picture enumerator</b> for a picture function \(P\) defined on a set \(S\) will be</p>
\begin{equation*}
E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
\end{equation*}
<p id="p-1055">We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of \(S\) according to their pictures. Thus <a knowl="./knowl/uptothreefruits.html" knowl-id="xref-uptothreefruits" alt="Equation 4.1 " title="Equation 4.1 ">Formula¬†(4.1)</a> is the picture enumerator the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.</p>

In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.<a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-11" id="fn-11"><span class="footnote"><sup>‚Äâ3‚Äâ</sup></span></a><span id="hk-fn-11" class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology ‚Äúgenerating function‚Äù may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.</span></span> Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.</p>
<p id="p-1074">Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of \(y+1\) for \(x\) in the power series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i\text{,}\) because in order to interpret \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i\) as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the \((y+1)^i\) terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of \(y^0\text{,}\) and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any¬†\(y^i\text{.}\) (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute \(y+y^2\) for \(x\text{.}\) Can you see why?)</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-43"><header title="Subsection 4.1.4 Power series"><h3 class="heading hide-type" alt="Subsection 4.1.4 Power series">

For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted \(x\) for each of our pictures, the exponent \(i\) in the power \(x^i\) is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to \(x^i\text{.}\) After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of \(x\text{,}\) the coefficient of \(x^i\) is the number of fruit selections that use \(i\) pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute \(x^c\) for a picture, where \(c\) is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the \(i\) in an \(x^i\) term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to \(x^i\text{,}\) and the coefficient of \(x^i\) in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with \(i\) calories.

Factor \(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5\) out of the picture and look at what is left.  How is it related to your vertices of degree one? Now remove the vertices of degree 1 from the tree and write down the picture of the tree that remains.  What is special about the vertices of degree 1 of that tree. (You can just barely learn something from this with five vertex trees, so you might want to experiment a bit with six or seven vertex trees.)</p></span></span>
