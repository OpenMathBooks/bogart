<a href="sec_induction-graphstrees.html#graphsection" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-592">In <a href="s1-3-apps.html#Ramseysection" class="xref" alt="Subsection 1.3.4 Ramsey Numbers" title="Subsection 1.3.4 Ramsey Numbers">Section¬†1.3.4</a> we introduced the idea of a directed graph. Graphs consist of vertices and edges. We describe vertices and edges in much the same way as we describe points and lines in geometry: we don't really say what vertices and edges are, but we say what they do. We just don't have a complicated axiom system the way we do in geometry. A <dfn class="terminology">graph</dfn> consists of a set \(V\) called a vertex set and a set \(E\) called an edge set. Each member of \(V\) is called a <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn> and each member of \(E\) is called an <dfn class="terminology">edge</dfn>. Associated with each edge are two (not necessarily different) vertices called its endpoints. We draw pictures of graphs by drawing points to represent the vertices and line segments (curved if we choose) whose endpoints are at vertices to represent the edges. In <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-Threegraphs" alt="Figure 2.3.1 " title="Figure 2.3.1 ">Figure¬†2.3.1</a> we show three pictures of graphs.</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="Threegraphs"><img src="images/threegraphs.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">2.3.1</span>Three different graphs</figcaption></figure><p id="p-593">Each gray circle in the figure represents a vertex; each line segment represents an edge. You will note that we labelled the vertices; these labels are names we chose to give the vertices. We can choose names or not as we please. The third graph also shows that it is possible to have an edge that connects a vertex (like the one labelled \(y\)) to itself or it is possible to have two or more edges (like those between vertices \(v\) and \(y\)) between two vertices. The <dfn class="terminology">degree</dfn> of a vertex is the number of times it appears as the endpoint of edges; thus the degree of \(y\) in the third graph in the figure is four.</p>

Given a tree with two or more vertices, labelled with positive integers, we define a sequence \(b_1,b_2,\ldots\) of integers inductively as follows: If the tree has two vertices, the sequence consists of one entry, namely the label of the vertex with the larger label. Otherwise, let \(a_1\) be the lowest numbered vertex of degree 1 in the tree. Let \(b_1\) be the label of the unique vertex in the tree adjacent to \(a_1\) and write down \(b_1\text{.}\) For example, in the first graph in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-Threegraphs" alt="Figure 2.3.1 " title="Figure 2.3.1 ">Figure¬†2.3.1</a>, \(a_1\) is 1 and \(b_1\) is 2. Given \(a_1\) through \(a_{i-1}\text{,}\) let \(a_i\) be the lowest numbered vertex of degree 1 in the tree you get by deleting \(a_1\) through \(a_{i-1}\)and let \(b_i\) be the unique vertex in this new tree adjacent to \(a_i\text{.}\) For example, in the first graph in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-Threegraphs" alt="Figure 2.3.1 " title="Figure 2.3.1 ">Figure¬†2.3.1</a>, \(a_2=2\) and \(b_2=3\text{.}\) Then \(a_3=5\) and \(b_3=4\text{.}\) We use \(b\) to stand for the sequence of \(b_i\)s we get in this way. In the tree (the first graph) in <a knowl="./knowl/Threegraphs.html" knowl-id="xref-Threegraphs" alt="Figure 2.3.1 " title="Figure 2.3.1 ">Figure¬†2.3.1</a>, the sequence \(b\) is 2344378. (If you are unfamiliar with inductive (recursive) definition, you might want to write down some other labelled trees on eight vertices and construct the sequence of \(b_i\)s.)</p>

<a href="sec_induction-graphstrees.html#subsection-24" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-653">Many of the applications of trees arise from trying to find an efficient way to connect all the vertices of a graph. For example, in a telephone network, at any given time we have a certain number of wires (or microwave channels, or cellular channels) available for use. These wires or channels go from a specific place to a specific place. Thus the wires or channels may be thought of as edges of a graph and the places the wires connect may be thought of as vertices of that graph. A tree whose edges are some of the edges of a graph \(G\) and whose vertices are all of the vertices of the graph \(G\) is called a <dfn class="terminology">spanning tree</dfn> of \(G\text{.}\) A spanning tree for a telephone network will give us a way to route calls between any two vertices in the network.

<a href="sec_induction-graphstrees.html#subsection-25" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-659">Our motivation for talking about spanning trees was the idea of finding a minimum number of edges we need to connect all the edges of a communication network together. In many cases edges of a communication network come with costs associated with them. For example, one cell-phone operator charges another one when a customer of the first uses an antenna of the other. Suppose a company has offices in a number of cities and wants to put together a communication network connecting its various locations with high-speed computer communications, but to do so at minimum cost. Then it wants to take a graph whose vertices are the cities in which it has offices and whose edges represent possible communications lines between the cities. Of course there will not necessarily be lines between each pair of cities, and the company will not want to pay for a line connecting city \(i\) and city \(j\) if it can already connect them indirectly by using other lines it has chosen. Thus it will want to choose a spanning tree of minimum cost among all spanning trees of the communications graph. For reasons of this application, if we have a graph with numbers assigned to its edges, the sum of the numbers on the edges of a spanning tree of \(G\) will be called the <dfn class="terminology">cost</dfn> of the spanning tree.</p>
