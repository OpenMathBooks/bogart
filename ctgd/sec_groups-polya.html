</h1></header><section class="introduction" id="introduction-64"><p id="p-1714">George P√≥lya and Robert Redfield independently developed a theory of generating functions that describe the action of a group \(G\) on functions from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) when we know the action of \(G\) on \(S\text{.}\) P√≥lya's work on the subject is very accessible in its exposition, and so the subject has become popularly known as P√≥lya theory, though P√≥lya-Redfield theory would be a better name. In this section we develop the elements of this theory.</p>
<p id="p-1715">The idea of coloring a set \(S\) has many applications. For example, the set \(S\) might be the positions in a hydrocarbon molecule which are occupied by hydrogen, and the group could be the group of spatial symmetries of the molecule (that is, the group of permutations of the atoms of the molecule that move the molecule around so that in its final position the molecule cannot be distinguished from the original molecule). The colors could then be radicals (including hydrogen itself) that we could substitute for each hydrogen position in the molecule. Then the number of orbits of colorings is the number of chemically different compounds we could create by using these substitutions.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-24" id="fn-24"><span class="footnote"><sup>‚Äâ6‚Äâ</sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-24" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">There is a fascinating subtle issue of what makes two molecules different.  For example, suppose we have a molecule in the form of a cube, with one atom at each vertex.  If we interchange the top and bottom faces of the cube, each atom is still connected to exactly the same atoms as before.   However we cannot achieve this permutation of the vertices by a member of the rotation group of the cube.  It could well be that the two versions of the molecule interact with other molecules in different ways, in which case we would consider them chemically different.  On the other hand if the two versions interact with other molecules in the same way, we would have no reason to consider them chemically different.  This kind of symmetry is an example of what is called <em class="terminology">chirality</em> in chemistry.</span></span></p>
<p id="p-1716">In <a knowl="./knowl/butyl-alcohol-isomers.html" knowl-id="xref-butyl-alcohol-isomers" alt="Figure 6.3.1 " title="Figure 6.3.1 ">Figure¬†6.3.1</a> we show two different ways to substitute the OH radical for a hydrogen atom in the chemical diagram we gave for butane in <a href="InductionRecursion.html" alt="Chapter 2 Applications of Induction and Recursion in Combinatorics and Graph Theory" title="Chapter 2 Applications of Induction and Recursion in Combinatorics and Graph Theory">Chapter¬†2</a>. We have colored one vertex of degree 1 with the radical OH and the rest with the atom H. There are only two distinct ways to do this, as the OH must either connect to an ‚Äúend‚Äù C or a ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù C. This shows that there are two different forms, called isomers of the compound shown. This compound is known as butyl alcohol.</p>

<figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">6.3.1</span>The two different isomers of butyl alcohol.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-1717">So think intuitively about some ‚Äúfigure‚Äù that has places to be colored. (Think of the faces of a cube, the beads on a necklace, circles at the vertices of an \(n\)-gon, etc.) How can we picture the coloring? If we number the places to be colored, say 1 to \(n\text{,}\) then a function from \([n]\) to the colors is exactly our coloring; if our colors are blue, green and red, then \(BBGRRGBG\) describes a typical coloring of 8 such places. Unless the places are somehow ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù numbered, this idea of a coloring imposes structure that is not really there. Even if the structure is there, visualizing our colorings in this way doesn't ‚Äúpull together‚Äù any common features of different colorings; we are simply visualizing all possible functions. We have a group (think of it as symmetries of the figure you are imagining) that acts on the places. That group then acts in a natural way on the colorings of the places and we are interested in orbits of the colorings. Thus we want a picture that pulls together the common features of the colorings in an orbit. One way to pull together similarities of colorings would be to let the letters we are using as pictures of colors commute as we did with our pictures in <a href="ch_genfns.html" alt="Chapter 4 Generating Functions" title="Chapter 4 Generating Functions">Chapter¬†4</a>; then our picture \(BBGRRGBG\) becomes \(B^3G^3R^2\text{,}\) so our picture now records simply how many times we use each color. If you think about how we defined the action of a group on a set of functions, you will see that a group element won't change how many times each color is used; it simply moves colors to different places. Thus the picture we now have of a given coloring is an equally appropriate picture for each coloring in an orbit. One natural question for us to ask is ‚ÄúHow many orbits have a given picture?‚Äù</p>

As above, we can ask how many orbits of the colorings have any given picture. We can think of a multivariable generating function in which the letters we use to picture individual colors are the variables, and the coefficient of a picture is the number of orbits with that picture. Such a generating function is an answer to our natural question, and so it is this sort of generating function we will seek. Since the CFB theorem was our primary tool for saying how many orbits we have, it makes sense to think about whether the CFB theorem has an analog in terms of pictures of orbits.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-68"><header title="Subsection 6.3.1 The Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem"><h1 class="heading hide-type" alt="Subsection 6.3.1 The Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem">

<p id="p-1727">Suppose now we have a group \(G\) acting on a set and we have a picture function on that set with the additional feature that for each orbit of the group, all its elements have the same picture. In this circumstance we define the picture of an orbit or multiorbit to be the picture of any one of its members. The <em class="terminology">orbit enumerator</em> \(\Orb(G,S)\) is the sum of the pictures of the orbits. (Note that this is the same as the sum of the pictures of the <em class="terminology">multiorbits</em>.) The <em class="terminology">fixed point enumerator</em> \(\Fix(G, S)\) is the sum of the pictures of each of the fixed points of each of the elements of \(G\text{.}\) We are going to construct a generating function analog of the CFB theorem. The main idea of the proof of the CFB theorem was to try to compute in two different ways the number of elements (i.e. the sum of all the multiplicities of the elements) in the union of all the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. Suppose instead we try to compute the sum of all the pictures of all the elements in the union of the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. By thinking about how this sum relates to \(\Orb(G,S)\) and \(\Fix(G,S)\text{,}\) find an analog of the CFB theorem that relates these two enumerators. State and prove this theorem. </p></article><p id="p-1729">We call the theorem of <a knowl="./knowl/orbit-fixed-point-thm.html" knowl-id="xref-orbit-fixed-point-thm" alt="Problem 311 " title="Problem 311 ">Problem¬†311</a> the <em class="terminology">Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem</em>.
