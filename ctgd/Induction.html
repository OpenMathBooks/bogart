So there are certainly some values of \(n\) for which an \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets. One way to prove that an \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets for all values of \(n\) is to argue by contradiction. For this purpose, suppose there is a nonnegative integer \(n\) such that an \(n\)-element set doesn't have exactly \(2^n\) subsets. In that case there may be more than one such \(n\text{.}\) Choose \(k\) to be the smallest such \(n\text{.}\) Notice that \(k -1\) is still a positive integer, because \(k\) can't be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Since \(k\) was the smallest value of \(n\) we could choose to make the statement ‚ÄúAn \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets‚Äù false, what do you know about the number of subsets of a \((k - 1)\)-element set? What do you know about the number of subsets of the \(k\)-element set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k \}\) that don't contain \(k\text{?}\) What do you know about the number of subsets of \(\{1,
2, \ldots,  k \}\) that do contain \(k\text{?}\) What does the sum principle tell you about the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k \}\text{?}\) Notice that this contradicts the way in which we chose \(k\text{,}\) and the only assumption that went into our choice of \(k\) was that ``there is a nonnegative integer \(n\) such that an \(n\)-element set doesn't have exactly \(2^n\) subsets." Since this assumption has led us to a contradiction, it must be false. What can you now conclude about the statement ``for every nonnegative integer \(n\text{,}\) an n-element set has exactly \(2^n\) subsets?"</p></article></article><article class="example-like" id="sumodd"><h5 class="heading">

In both cases we used the method of proof by contradiction; for that purpose we assumed that there was a value of \(n\) for which our formula wasn't true. We then chose \(k\) to be the smallest value of \(n\) for which our formula wasn't true. This meant that when \(n\) was \(k-1\text{,}\) our formula was true, (or else that \(k-1\) wasn't a nonnegative integer in <a knowl="./knowl/subsetsbysmallestcounterexample.html" knowl-id="xref-subsetsbysmallestcounterexample" alt="Problem 360 " title="Problem 360 ">Problem¬†360</a> or that \(k-1\) wasn't a positive integer in <a knowl="./knowl/sumodd.html" knowl-id="xref-sumodd" alt="Problem 361 " title="Problem 361 ">Problem¬†361</a>). What we did next was the crux of the proof. We showed that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implied the truth of our statement for \(n=k\text{.}\) This gave us a contradiction to the assumption that there was an \(n\) that made the statement false. In fact, we will see that we can bypass entirely the use of proof by contradiction. We used it to help you discover the central ideas of the technique of proof by mathematical induction.</p>
<p id="p-1976">The central core of mathematical induction is the proof that the truth of a statement about the integer \(n\) for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of the statement for \(n=k\text{.}\) For example, once we know that a set of size 0 has \(2^0\) subsets, if we have proved our implication, we can then conclude that a set of size 1 has \(2^1\) subsets, from which we can conclude that a set of size 2 has \(2^2\) subsets, from which we can conclude that a set of size 3 has \(2^3\) subsets, and so on up to a set of size \(n\) having \(2^n\) subsets for any nonnegative integer \(n\) we choose. In other words, although it was the idea of proof by contradiction that led us to think about such an implication, we can now do without the contradiction at all. What we need to prove a statement about \(n\) by this method is a place to start, that is a value \(b\) of \(n\) for which we know the statement to be true, and then a proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of the statement for \(n=k\) whenever \(k&gt;b\text{.}\)</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-74"><header title="Subsection B.1.2 Mathematical induction"><h1 class="heading hide-type" alt="Subsection B.1.2 Mathematical induction">

<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-18"><p id="p-1982">Our statement is true when \(n=0\text{,}\) because a set of size 0 is the empty set and the empty set has \(1=2^0\) subsets. (This step of our proof is called a <em class="terminology">base step</em>.) Now suppose that \(k&gt;0\) and every set with \(k-1\) elements has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets.  Suppose \(S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_k\}\) is a set with \(k\) elements. We partition the subsets of \(S\) into two blocks.  Block \(B_1\) consists of the subsets that do not contain \(a_n\) and block \(B_2\) consists of the subsets that do contain \(a_n\text{.}\)  Each set in \(B_1\) is a subset of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\text{,}\) and each subset of \(\{a_1,a_2, \ldots
a_{k-1}\}\) is in \(B_1\text{.}\)  Thus \(B_1\) is the set of all subsets of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\text{.}\)  Therefore by our assumption in the first sentence of this paragraph, the size of \(B_1\) is \(2^{k-1}\text{.}\)  Consider the function from \(B_2\) to \(B_1\) which takes a subset of \(S\) including \(a_n\) and removes \(a_n\) from it.  This function is defined on \(B_2\text{,}\) because every set in \(B_2\) contains \(a_n\text{.}\)  This function is onto, because if \(T\) is a set in \(B_1\text{,}\) then \(T\cup \{a_k\}\) is a set in \(B_2\) which the function sends to \(T\text{.}\)  This function is one-to-one because if \(V\) and \(W\) are two different sets in \(B_2\text{,}\) then removing \(a_k\) from them gives two different sets in \(B_1\text{.}\)  Thus we have a bijection between \(B_1\) and \(B_2\text{,}\) so \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) have the same size.  Therefore by the sum principle the size of \(B_1\cup B_2\) is \(2^{k-1} +2^{k-1}=2^k\text{.}\)  Therefore \(S\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  This shows that if a set of size \(k-1\) has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets, then a set of size \(k\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, a set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets for every nonnegative integer \(n\text{.}\)</p></blockquote>
<p id="p-1983">The first sentence of the last paragraph is called the <em class="terminology">inductive hypothesis</em>. In an inductive proof we always make an inductive hypothesis as part of proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\text{.}\) The last paragraph itself is called the <em class="terminology">inductive step</em> of our proof. In an inductive step we derive the statement for \(n=k\) from the statement for \(n=k-1\text{,}\) thus proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\text{.}\) The last sentence in the last paragraph is called the <em class="terminology">inductive conclusion</em>. All inductive proofs should have a base step, an inductive hypothesis, an inductive step, and an inductive conclusion.</p>
<p id="p-1984">There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our base step was the case \(n=0\text{,}\) or in other words, we had \(b=0\text{.}\) However, in other proofs, \(b\) could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement for \(n=k\) required that \(k\) be at least 1, so that there would be an element \(a_k\) we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However, condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires that we be able to prove the implication for \(k&gt;0\text{,}\) so we were allowed to assume \(k&gt;0\text{.}\)</p>

<p id="p-1999">What is wrong with the following attempt at an inductive proof that all integers in any consecutive set of \(n\) integers are equal for every positive integer \(n\text{?}\) For an arbitrary integer \(i\text{,}\) all integers from \(i\) to \(i\) are equal, so our statement is true when \(n=1\text{.}\) Now suppose \(k&gt;1\) and all integers in any consecutive set of \(k-1\) integers are equal. Let \(S\) be a set of \(k\) consecutive integers. By the inductive hypothesis, the first \(k-1\) elements of \(S\) are equal and the last \(k-1\) elements of \(S\) are equal. Therefore all the elements in the set \(S\) are equal. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, for every positive \(n\text{,}\) every \(n\) consecutive integers are equal.</p>

However the particular way in which we stated the theorem is rather restrictive in that it requires us to derive each case from the immediately preceding case. This restriction is not necessary, and removing it leads us to a more general statement of the principal of mathematical induction which people often call the <em class="terminology">strong principle of mathematical induction</em>.

<p id="p-2006">What postage do you think we can make with five and six cent stamps? Is there a number \(N\) such that if \(n\ge N\text{,}\) then we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage?</p></article><p id="p-2008">You probably see that we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage as long as \(n\) is at least 20. However you didn't try to make 26 cents in postage by working with 25 cents; rather you saw that you could get 20 cents and then add six cents to that to get 26 cents. Thus if we want to prove by induction that we are right that if \(n\ge 20\text{,}\) then we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage, we are going to have to use the strong version of the principle of mathematical induction.</p>
<p id="p-2009">We know that we can make 20 cents with four five-cent stamps. Now we let \(k\) be a number greater than 20, and assume that it is possible to make any amount between 20 and \(k-1\) cents in postage with five and six cent stamps. Now if \(k\) is less than 25, it is 21, 22, 23, or 24. We can make 21 with three fives and one six. We can make 22 with two fives and two sixes, 23 with one five and three sixes, and 24 with four sixes. Otherwise \(k-5\) is between 20 and \(k-1\) (inclusive) and so by our inductive hypothesis, we know that \(k-5\) cents can be made with five and six cent stamps, so with one more five cent stamp, so can \(k\) cents. Thus by the (strong) principle of mathematical induction, we can make \(n\) cents in stamps with five and six cent stamps for each \(n\ge 20\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-2010">Some people might say that we really had five base cases, \(n=20\text{,}\) 21, 22, 23, and 24, in the proof above and once we had proved those five consecutive base cases, then we could reduce any other case to one of these base cases by successively subtracting 5. That is an appropriate way to look at the proof. A logician would say that it is also the case that, for example, by proving we could make 22 cents, we also proved that if we can make 20 cents and 21 cents in stamps, then we could also make 22 cents. We just didn't bother to use the assumption that we could make 20 cents and 21 cents! So long as one point of view or the other satisfies you, you are ready to use this kind of argument in proofs.</p>
