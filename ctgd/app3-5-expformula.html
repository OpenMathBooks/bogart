<a href="app3-5-expformula.html" class="permalink">¬∂</a></header><p id="p-2163">Exponential generating functions turn out to be quite useful in advanced work in combinatorics. One reason why is that it is often possible to give a combinatorial interpretation to the composition of two exponential generating functions. In particular, if \(f(x) =
\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}\) and \(g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j \frac{x^j}{j!}\text{,}\) it makes sense to form the composition \(f(g(x))\) because in so doing we need add together only finitely many terms in order to find the coefficient of \(\frac{x^n}{n!}\) in \(f(g(x))\) since in the EGF \(g(x)\) the dummy variable \(j\) starts at 1. Since our study of combinatorial structures has not been advanced enough to give us applications of a general formula for the composition of the EGF, we will not give here the combinatorial interpretation of this composition. However we have seen some examples where one particular composition can be applied. Namely, if \(f(x) = e^x = \exp(x)\text{,}\) then \(f(g(x)) =\ exp(g(x))\) is well defined when \(b_0=0\text{.}\) We have seen three examples in which an EGF is \(e^{f(x)}\) where \(f(x)\) is another EGF. There is a fourth example in which the exponential function is slightly hidden.</p>

In each case our EGF \(f(x)\) involved the number of structures of a certain type (partitions, telephone networks, tennis pairings, permutations) that used only one set of an appropriate kind. (That is, we had a partition with one part, a telephone network consisting either of one person or two people connected to each other, a tennis pairing of one set of two people, or a permutation with one cycle.) Our EGF \(g(x)\) was the number of structures of the same ‚Äútype‚Äù (we put type in quotation marks here because we don't plan to define it formally) that could consist of any number of sets of the appropriate kind. Notice that the order of these sets was irrelevant. For example we don't order the blocks of a partition and a product of disjoint cycles is the same no matter what order we use to write down the product. Thus we were relating the EGF for structures which were somehow ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù to the EGF for structures which were sets of building blocks. For a reason that you will see later, it is common to call the building blocks <b class="terminology">connected</b> structures. Notice that our connected structures were all based on nonempty sets, so we had no connected structures whose value was the empty set. Thus in each case, if \(f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}\text{,}\) we would have \(a_0=0\text{.}\) The relationship between the EGFs was always \(g(x) = e^{f(x)}\text{.}\) We now give a combinatorial explanation for this relationship.</p>

As you showed in <a knowl="./knowl/oneblockpartitions.html" knowl-id="xref-oneblockpartitions" alt="Problem 382 " title="Problem 382 ">Problem¬†382</a> the generating function for partitions with just one block is \(e^x-1\text{.}\) Thus by the exponential formula, \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the EGF for sets of subsets of the positive integers whose values are disjoint sets whose union is any particular set \(N\) of size \(n\text{.}\) This set of disjoint sets partitions the set \(N\text{.}\) Thus \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the EGF for partitions of sets of size \(n\text{.}\) (As we wrote our description, it is the EGF for partitions of \(n\)-element subsets of the positive integers, but any two \(n\)-element sets have the same number of partitions.)

<p id="p-2200">Explain why it is that if \(C\) is a connected component of a graph and \(E'\) is the set of all edges of the graph that connect vertices in \(C\text{,}\) then the graph with vertex set \(C\) and edge set \(E'\) is a connected graph. We call this graph a <b class="terminology">connected component graph</b> of the original graph.</p></article><p id="p-2202">The last sequence of problems shows that we may think of any graph as the set of its connected component graphs. (Once we know them, we know all the vertices and all the edges of the graph). Notice that a graph is connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component. Since the connected components form a partition of the vertex set of a graph, the exponential formula will relate the EGF for the number of connected graphs on \(n\) vertices with the EGF for the number of graphs (connected or not) on \(n\) vertices. However because we can draw as many edges as we want between two vertices of a graph, there are infinitely many graphs on \(n\) vertices, and so the problem of counting them is uninteresting. We can make it interesting by considering <b class="terminology">simple graphs</b>, namely graphs in which each edge has two distinct endpoints and no two edges connect the same two vertices. It is because connected graphs form the building blocks for viewing all graphs as sets of connected components that we refer to the building blocks for structures counted by the EGF in the exponential formula as connected structures.</p>
